0,2,Savoy cabbage,Brassica oleracea var. sabauda,"Savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea convar. capitata var. sabauda L. ) is a variety of the cabbage, a cultivar of the plant species Brassica oleracea. Savoy cabbage is a winter vegetable. A variety of the savoy cabbage is the January King Cabbage. Savoy cabbage can be used in a variety of recipes. It pairs well with red wine, apples, spices, horseradish and meat. It can be used for roulades, in stews and soups, as well as roasted plain and drizzled with olive oil. Cabbage that is heavy for its size with leaves that are unblemished and have a bright, fresh look are signs of desirable quality. Whole cabbages are preferred whenever possible as pre-cut or preshredded cabbage has a greatly diminished vitamin content. Peak season for most cabbages runs from November through April. Fresh whole cabbage will keep in the refrigerator for one to six weeks depending on type and variety. Hard green, white or red cabbages will keep the longest while the looser Savoy and Chinese varieties need to be consumed more quickly. It is necessary to keep the outer leaves intact without washing when storing since moisture hastens decay. Cabbage provides fiber, vitamins A, C, K and B6, folate, potassium, manganese, thiamin, calcium, iron and magnesium.",,Savoy cabbage,2.jpg,image/jpeg,155178.0,2012-04-20 09:39:54 UTC,2.0,Vegetables,Cabbages,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:15 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:22 UTC,,,False,specific,1216010.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,113.0,1150.0,3100.0,4550.0,100.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,5630.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,381786.7,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,22600.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,347481.925,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0013,953.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,96490.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,61520.0,100.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,41850.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,50600.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,18450.0,,0.0,5630.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,11200.0,,13090.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,5600.0,,0.0,0.0,25.14566,19.785362,22

3,6,Garden onion,Allium cepa,"The onion (Allium cepa) (Latin 'cepa' = onion), also known as the bulb onion or common onion, is used as a vegetable and is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium. This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food, such as the Japanese bunching onion (A. fistulosum), the Egyptian onion (A. í„proliferum), and the Canada onion (A. canadense). The name ""wild onion"" is applied to a number of Allium species but A. cepa is exclusively known from cultivation and its ancestral wild original form is not known, although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions.The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant, but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season.Onions are cultivated and used around the world. As a foodstuff they are usually served cooked, as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish, but can also be eaten raw or used to make pickles or chutneys. They are pungent when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which irritate the eyes.

5,8,Garlic,Allium sativum,"With a history of human use of over 7,000 years, garlic (Allium sativum) is native to central Asia, and has long been a staple in the Mediterranean region, as well as a frequent seasoning in Asia, Africa, and Europe.

It is the sole species of the genus Anethum.  Dill is widely grown in Eurasia where its leaves and seeds are used as a herb or spice for flavouring food. Like caraway, the fern-like leaves of dill are aromatic and are used to flavor many foods such as gravlax (cured salmon) and other fish dishes, borscht and other soups, as well as pickles (where the dill flower is sometimes used).

12,16,Peanut,Arachis hypogaea,"The peanut, also known as the groundnut and the goober and taxonomically classified as <i>Arachis hypogaea</i>, is a legume crop grown mainly for its edible seeds. It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics, being important to both small and large commercial producers. It is classified as both a grain legume and, because of its high oil content, an oil crop. World annual production of shelled peanuts was 42 million tonnes in 2014.

13,17,Burdock,Arctium lappa,"Arctium lappa, commonly called greater burdock, gob?,edible burdock, lappa, or beggar's buttons, is a biennial plant of the Arctium (burdock) genus in the Asteraceae family, cultivated in gardens for its root used as a vegetable. It is an invasive weed of high-nitrogen soils.The root contains a fair amount of gob? dietary fiber (GDF, 6g per 100g), calcium, potassium, amino acids, and is low calorie. It contains polyphenols that causes darkened surface and muddy harshness by formation of tannin-iron complexes. Those polyphenols are caffeoylquinic acid derivatives.The root is very crisp and has a sweet, mild, and pungent flavor with a little muddy harshness that can be reduced by soaking julienned/shredded roots in water for five to ten minutes. The harshness shows excellent harmonization with pork in miso soup (tonjiru) and takikomi gohan (a Japanese-style pilaf).",36545.0,Arctium_lappa,17.jpg,image/jpeg,127987.0,2012-04-20 09:34:44 UTC,17.0,Vegetables,Root vegetables,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:15 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:23 UTC,,,False,specific,4217.0,True,,,,,,0.0,,,,36.0,,,,,54.0,2.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,214.66666666666666,1903.3333333333333,2300.0,36390.0,2976.958333333333,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,176.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,114135.9149,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.44,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,327.099,0.0,,118.455,10.08,,0.0,,,,,,,1000.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,67943.93250000001,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,156.0,,,,,,,,295.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,140.054,0.032,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,109.0,69.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,87.0,337.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,4159.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,67386.33,,0.0,3400.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048,,,,,,1960.095,,3017.5510000000004,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,257.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,71.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,15.052781,3.0633297,22
14,18,Horseradish,Armoracia rusticana,"Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana, syn. Cochlearia armoracia) is a perennial plant of the Brassicaceae family (which also includes mustard, wasabi, broccoli, and cabbage). The plant is probably native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It is now popular around the world. It grows up to 1.5Œæmetres (5 feet) tall, and is cultivated primarily for its large, white, tapered root. The intact horseradish root has hardly any aroma. When cut or grated, however, enzymes from the now-broken plant cells break down sinigrin to produce allyl isothiocyanate, which irritates the mucous membranes of the sinuses and eyes. Once exposed to air (via grating) or heat, if not used immediately or mixed in vinegar, the grated mash darkens, loses its pungency, and becomes unpleasantly bitter-tasting.",23044.0,Horseradish,18.jpg,image/jpeg,133514.0,2012-04-20 09:33:47 UTC,18.0,Herbs and Spices,Spices,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:15 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:23 UTC,,,False,specific,3704.0,True,,,,,,1.0,,,,127.0,,,,,285.0,53.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,1.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,229.0,1180.0,5400.0,22922.5,696.6666666666666,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,3708.201,0.0,0.0,0.0,239.099,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,1.139,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,551.0,2167.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.004,,5096.0,,12270.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3977.243,550.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,290.048,,,,,0.043,,,185.0,83.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.099,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,20.373,216.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,988.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,1035.066,,0.0,554.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,1929.0,,5938.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.054,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,3699.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,10.0,,0.0,0.0,-21.432873,-15.134692,14
15,19,Tarragon,Artemisia dracunculus,"Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus) is a species of perennial herb in the family Asteraceae. One sub-species, Artemisia dracunculus var. sativa, is cultivated for use of the leaves as an aromatic culinary herb. In some other sub-species, the characteristic aroma is largely absent. The species is polymorphic. Informal names for distinguishing the variations include ""French tarragon"" (best for culinary use), ""Russian tarragon"" (typically better than wild tarragon but not as good as so-called French tarragon for culinary use), and ""wild tarragon"" (covers various states).Tarragon is one of the four fines herbes of French cooking, and is particularly suitable for chicken, fish and egg dishes. Tarragon is the main flavoring component of Bí©arnaise sauce. Fresh, lightly bruised sprigs of tarragon are steeped in vinegar to produce tarragon vinegar.Tarragon is used to flavor a popular carbonated soft drink in the countries of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia and, by extension, Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

21,25,Common beet,Beta vulgaris,"The beet (Beta vulgaris) is a plant in the Chenopodiaceae family which is now included in Amaranthaceae family. It is best known in its numerous cultivated varieties, the most well known of which is the root vegetable known as the beetroot or garden beet. However, other cultivated varieties include the leaf vegetable chard, as well as the root vegetable sugar beet, which is important in the production of table sugar, and mangelwurzel, which is a fodder crop. Three subspecies are typically recognised. All cultivated varieties fall into the subspecies Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris, while Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima, commonly known as the sea beet, is the wild ancestor of these, and is found throughout the Mediterranean, the Atlantic coast of Europe, the Near East, and India. A second wild subspecies, Beta vulgaris subsp. adanensis, occurs from Greece to Syria. The roots are most commonly deep red-purple in color, but come in a wide variety of other shades, including golden yellow and red-and-white striped. Beta vulgaris is a herbaceous biennial or, rarely, perennial plant with leafy stems growing to 1äóñ2 m tall. The leaves are heart-shaped, 5äóñ20Œæcm long on wild plants (often much larger in cultivated plants). The flowers are produced in dense spikes; each flower is very small, 3äóñ5Œæmm diameter, green or tinged reddish, with five petals; they are wind pollinated. The fruit is a cluster of hard nutlets.",20681.0,Beet,25.jpg,image/jpeg,81715.0,2012-04-20 09:44:15 UTC,25.0,Vegetables,Leaf vegetables,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:16 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:23 UTC,,,False,specific,161934.0,True,,,,,,0.0,,,,26.09090909090909,,,,,43.90909090909091,3.909090909090909,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,102.5,1490.0,2327.2727272727275,9100.90909090909,136.36363636363637,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1221.019,0.0,0.0,0.0,134203.53518,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,90761.705,699.76,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.34,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,265222.6511,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,149.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,284.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,72.0,121.0,2524.1438,0.7,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,14.0,0.02,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,9291.0003,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,61133.212,,0.0,626.454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,10176.9747,,161763.93000000002,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.735,,4435.52,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,16.503672,17.662893,22

26,30,Common cabbage,Brassica oleracea,"Brassica oleracea is the species of plant that includes many common foods as cultivars, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, savoy, and Chinese kale. In its uncultivated form it is known as wild cabbage. It is native to coastal southern and western Europe. Its tolerance of salt and lime and its intolerance of competition from other plants typically restrict its natural occurrence to limestone sea cliffs, like the chalk cliffs on both sides of the English Channel.B. oleracea has become established as an important human food crop plant, used because of its large food reserves, which are stored over the winter in its leaves. It is rich in essential nutrients including vitamin C.

Kohlrabi can be eaten raw as well as cooked.Kohlrabi stems are surrounded by two distinct fibrous layers that do not soften appreciably when cooked. These layers are generally peeled away prior to cooking or serving raw, with the result that the stems often provide a smaller amount of food than one might assume from their intact appearance.The Kohlrabi root is frequently used raw in salad or slaws. It has a texture similar to that of a broccoli stem, but with a flavor that is sweeter and less vegetal.Kohlrabi leaves are edible and can be used interchangeably with collard and kale.Kohlrabi is an important part of the Kashmiri diet and one of the most commonly cooked foods. It is prepared with its leaves and served with a light gravy and eaten with rice.Some varieties are grown as feed for cattle.",530960.0,Kohlrabi,33.jpg,image/jpeg,101642.0,2012-04-20 09:30:26 UTC,35.0,Vegetables,Root vegetables,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:16 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:23 UTC,,,False,specific,109379.0,True,,,,,,0.0,,,,7.666666666666667,,,,,21.333333333333332,27.333333333333332,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,78.0,1766.6666666666667,2766.6666666666665,13180.416666666666,270.72222222222223,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,744.17,0.0,0.0,,1110.0,2665.00044,0.0,0.0,0.0,51808.0292,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,386.0,,,,,,0.0,31.0,,1000.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,84.003,6422.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,465.0,,,3974.0,25.0,,,3840.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,200.0,0.0,69747.6522,0.0,0.0,,3360.0,0.0,0.0,0.28,6677.0034,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,984.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,5288.0,1377.0,52.6,,,0.0,0.0,,,1200.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,298.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,4936.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,1792.127,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,168.0,0.0,2114.0,,0.0,3483.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,129.0,,,,,,13031.0174,,3713.04836,,,,0.025,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,3178.0,478.0,,,,,23.0,1.0,0.0,80.0,,0.0,0.0,8.236554,4.971967,22

33,37,Pigeon pea,Cajanus cajan,"The pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) is a perennial legume from the family Fabaceae. Since its domestication in India at least 3,500 years ago, its seeds have become a common food grain in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It is consumed on a large scale mainly in south Asia and is a major source of protein for the population of that subcontinent. Pigeon peas are both a food crop (dried peas, flour, or green vegetable peas) and a forage/cover crop. In combination with cereals, pigeon peas make a well-balanced human food. The dried peas may be sprouted briefly, then cooked, for a flavor different from the green or dried peas. Sprouting also enhances the digestibility of dried pigeon peas via the reduction of indigestible sugars that would otherwise remain in the cooked dried peas. Pigeon peas contain high levels of protein and the important amino acids methionine, lysine, and tryptophan.

It is native to the tropics of the Americas, perhaps from southern Mexico and neighbouring Central America. It was first cultivated in Mexicoseveral centuries before the emergence of the Mesoamerican classical civilizations. The papaya is a large, tree-like plant, with a single stem growing from 5 to 10 m (to ft) tall, with spirally arranged leaves confined to the top of the trunk. The lower trunk is conspicuously scarred where leaves and fruit were borne. The leaves are large, 50äóñ70Œæcm in diameter, deeply palmately lobed, with seven lobes. Unusually for such large plants, the trees are dioecious. The tree is usually unbranched, unless lopped. The flowers are similar in shape to the flowers of the Plumeria, but are much smaller and wax-like. They appear on the axils of the leaves, maturing into large fruit - 15äóñ45Œæcm long and 10äóñ30Œæcm in diameter. The fruit is ripe when it feels soft (as soft as a ripe avocado or a bit softer) and its skin has attained an amber to orange hue.

Pecans were one of the most recently domesticated major crops. Although wild pecans were well known among native and colonial Americans as a delicacy, the commercial growing of pecans in the United States did not begin until the 1880s. Today, the U.S. produces between 80% and 95% of the world's pecans, with an annual crop of 150äóñ200 thousand tons.In 100 g, pecans provide 691 Calories and over 100% of the Daily Value (DV) for total fat. Pecans are a rich source of dietary fiber (38% DV), manganese (214% DV), magnesium (34% DV), phosphorus (40% DV), zinc (48% DV) and thiamin (57% DV).[20] Pecans are also a good source (10-19% DV) of protein, iron, and B vitamins.

It is sometimes called chicory in the United States and is called chicorí©e frisí©e in French. Further confusion results from the fact that frisí©e also refers to greens lightly wilted with oil. (2) Escarole, or broad-leaved endive (var latifolia), has broad, pale green leaves and is less bitter than the other varieties. Varieties or names include broad-leaved endive, Bavarian endive, Batavian endive, grumolo, scarola, and scarole.

58,63,Saffron,Crocus sativus,"Saffron is a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, commonly known as the saffron crocus. Crocus is a genus in the family Iridaceae. Saffron crocus grows to 20-30 cm (8-12 in) and bears up to four flowers, each with three vivid crimson stigmas, which are the distal end of a carpel. Together with the styles, or stalks that connect the stigmas to their host plant, the dried stigmas are used mainly in various cuisines as a seasoning and colouring agent. Saffron, long among the world's most costly spices by weight, is native to Greece or Southwest Asia and was first cultivated in Greece. As a genetically monomorphic clone, it was slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia and was later brought to parts of North Africa, North America, and Oceania.Saffron's taste and iodoform or hay-like fragrance result from the chemicals picrocrocin and safranal. It also contains a carotenoid pigment, crocin, which imparts a rich golden-yellow hue to dishes and textiles. Its recorded history is attested in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical treatise compiled under Ashurbanipal, and it has been traded and used for over four millennia. Iran now accounts for approximately 90% of the world production of saffron.",501794.0,Saffron,63.jpg,image/jpeg,108338.0,2012-04-20 09:42:34 UTC,67.0,Herbs and Spices,Spices,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:18 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:23 UTC,,,False,specific,82528.0,True,,,,,,3.0,,,,390.0,,,,,754.0,1242.0,,0.0,6.0,,,,,13.0,,,,,0.0,,6.0,,,,804.0,11430.0,3900.0,57920.0,7682.5,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,140.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16427.8606,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.003,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,31.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,9100.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,822.0,,7165.10132,0.0,0.0,,0.025,0.0,0.0,0.0,8378.0137,2260.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.217,,,,,,,,15620.0,0.0,0.8500000000000001,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.466,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,628.0,1231.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.368,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,881.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,59482.0,,0.0,101.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.599,,,,,,0.0,,991.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.8,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,57.0,,0.0,0.0,-10.892636,-6.4689274,14
59,64,Muskmelon,Cucumis melo,"Muskmelon (Cucumis melo) is a species of melon that has been developed into many cultivated varieties. These include smooth skinned varieties such as honeydew, crenshaw and casaba, and different netted cultivars (cantaloupe, Persian melon and Santa Claus or Christmas melon). The Armenian cucumber is also a variety of muskmelon, but its shape, taste, and culinary uses more closely resemble those of a cucumber. The large number of cultivars in this species approaches that found in wild cabbage, though morphological variation is not as extensive. It is a fruit of a type called pepo. Muskmelon is native to Persia, Anatolia, Armenia, and adjacent areas on the west and the east which is believed to be their center of origin and development, with a secondary center including the northwest provinces of India and Afghanistan. Although truly wild forms of C. melo have not been found, several related wild species have been noted in those regions.",22362.0,Muskmelon,64.jpg,image/jpeg,130759.0,2012-04-20 09:39:44 UTC,68.0,Gourds,Gourds,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:18 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:23 UTC,,,False,specific,3656.0,True,,,,,,0.0,,,,3.0,,,,,30.0,39.25,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,88.0,834.0,793.3333333333333,15978.491666666667,6608.291666666667,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,13992.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,6798.5576,0.0,0.0,0.0,91462.29368,,0.0,0.0,,,,,73160.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,50.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,748.002,0.0,0.0,,1819.091,0.388,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,172.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,171134.69900000005,0.0,0.0,0.0,46409.0,0.0,0.0,3058.323,36714.025,0.20500000000000002,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,41031.851,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3746.0422,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,10518.754,39.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,4973.018,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,8424.1236,,0.0,9973.1018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,111443.9913,,13037.18,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,25.007,,,,,,,3830.0,0.0,16735.063,,0.0,0.0,10.070249,12.920211,13

62,67,Cumin,Cuminum cyminum,"Cumin (Cuminum cyminum) is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae as caraway, parsley, and dill., native from the east Mediterranean to India. Its seeds (each one contained within a fruit, which is dried) are used in the cuisines of many different cultures, in both whole and ground form. It also has many uses as a traditional medicinal plant.  In the ancient Egyptian civilization, cumin was used as spice and as preservative in mummification. Cumin seed is used as a spice for its distinctive flavour and aroma. Cumin can be found in some cheeses, such as Leyden cheese, and in some traditional breads from France. Cumin can be an ingredient in chili powder (often Tex-Mex or Mexican-style), and is found in achiote blends, adobos, sofrito, garam masala, curry powder, and bahaarat. In South Asian cooking, it is often combined with coriander seeds in a powdered mixture called dhana jeera. Cumin's distinctive flavour is strong. It has a warm aroma due to its essential oil content. Its main constituent aroma compounds are cuminaldehyde (a promising agent against alpha-synuclein aggregation) and cuminic alcohol. Other important aroma compounds of toasted cumin are the substituted pyrazines, 2-ethoxy-3-isopropylpyrazine, 2-methoxy-3-sec-butylpyrazine, and 2-methoxy-3-methylpyrazine. Other components include ‘_-terpinene, safranal, p-cymene and ‘_-pinene  [Wikipedia]",501839.0,Cumin,67.jpg,image/jpeg,73485.0,2012-04-20 09:32:32 UTC,73.0,Herbs and Spices,Spices,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:18 UTC,2017-06-22 21:53:37 UTC,,,False,specific,52462.0,True,,,,,,212.0,,,,13618.0,,,,,3103.0,176.0,,0.0,212.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,971.0,17810.0,10500.0,47420.0,21244.5,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,249.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,773.3810000000001,,,,,318.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,1832.0,295.0,394.0,0.0,,,,,,1.674,0.0,1871.414,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,159.0,,0.0,,5229.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1345.0,2115.1143,796.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,144.0,,,0.00059,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,5970.345799999999,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,447.003,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,209.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,611.0,,0.0,1435.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,761.0,,581.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.035,,,,,20.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,124.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-16.161192,-22.992373,14

It is sometimes conflated with Diplotaxis tenuifolia, the perennial wall rocket, another plant of the Brassicaceae family, which in the past was used in the same manner. Eruca sativa, which is widely popular as a salad vegetable, is a species of Eruca native to the Mediterranean region, from Morocco and Portugal in the west to Syria, Lebanon and Turkey in the east. The Latin adjective sativa in the plant's binomial is derived from satum, the supine of the verb sero, meaning ""to sow"", indicating that the seeds of the plant were sown in gardens. Eruca sativa differs from E. vesicaria in having early deciduous sepals. Some botanists consider it a subspecies of Eruca vesicaria: E. vesicaria subsp. sativa.

74,82,Fennel,Foeniculum vulgare,"Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) is a plant species in the genus Foeniculum (treated as the sole species in the genus by most botanists). It is a member of the family Apiaceae (formerly the Umbelliferae). It is a hardy, perennial, umbelliferous herb, with yellow flowers and feathery leaves. It is indigenous to the shores of the Mediterranean but has become widely naturalized in many parts of the world, especially on dry soils near the sea-coast and on riverbanks. It is a highly aromatic and flavorful herb with culinary and medicinal uses and, along with the similar-tasting anise, is one of the primary ingredients of absinthe. Florence fennel or finocchio is a selection with a swollen, bulb-like stem base that is used as a vegetable. Fennel is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the mouse moth and the anise swallowtail.",29509.0,Fennel,82.jpg,image/jpeg,102175.0,2012-04-20 09:30:27 UTC,88.0,Herbs and Spices,Herbs,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:19 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:24 UTC,,,False,specific,48038.0,True,,,,,,,,,,9910.0,,,,,1690.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,566.3333333333334,8520.0,21175.0,26988.625,8778.333333333334,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.01,0.0,0.0,,0.0,203.0,0.0292,0.0,0.0,13378.00549,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,8297.4354,,,,,19740.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,3774.00029,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,1468.023,47478.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,42.0,,1544.0,,129657.021,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,417.0,7808.048200000001,3500.0,552.3340000000001,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,101350.0,,,,,,,,3951.831,7607.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,47.227,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,21000.0,7751.904,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,407.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,4000.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.2,,,,,0.0,22260.0,,0.0,847.159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,411.0,,,,,,18936.0009,,18590.1606,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,253.0,,,,0.131,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,32.0,0.0,1900.0,,0.0,0.0,0.8175107,3.391656,14

76,85,Soy bean,Glycine max,"The soybean (US) or soya bean (UK) (Glycine max) is a species of legume native to East Asia, widely grown for its edible bean which has numerous uses. The plant is classed as an oilseed rather than a pulse by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Fat-free (defatted) soybean meal is a significant and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many prepackaged meals; soy vegetable oil is another product of processing the soybean crop. For example, soybean products such as textured vegetable protein (TVP) are ingredients in many meat and dairy analogues. Soybeans produce significantly more protein per acre than most other uses of land. Traditional nonfermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk, and from the latter tofu and tofu skin. Fermented foods include soy sauce, fermented bean paste, natto, and tempeh, among others. The oil is used in many industrial applications. The main producers of soy are the United States (35%), Brazil (27%), Argentina (19%), China (6%) and India (4%).

84,95,Lettuce,Lactuca sativa,"Around 50 AD, lettuce leaves were often cooked and served by the Romans with an oil-and-vinegar dressing; however, smaller leaves were sometimes eaten raw. During the 81?96 AD reign of Domitian, the tradition of serving a lettuce salad before a meal began. Post-Roman Europe continued the tradition of poaching lettuce, mainly with large romaine types, as well as the method of pouring a hot oil and vinegar mixture over the leaves. Today, the majority of lettuce is grown for its leaves, although one type is grown for its stem and one for its seeds, which are made into an oil. Most lettuce is used in salads, either alone or with other greens, vegetables, meats and cheeses. Romaine lettuce is often used for Caesar salads, with a dressing that includes anchovies and eggs. Lettuce leaves can also be found in soups, sandwiches and wraps, while the stems are eaten both raw and cooked. The consumption of lettuce in China developed differently from in Western countries, due to health risks and cultural aversion to eating raw leaves. In that country, ""salads"" were created from cooked vegetables and served hot or cold. Lettuce was also used in a larger variety of dishes than in Western countries, contributing to a range of dishes including bean curd and meat dishes, soups and stir-frys plain or with other vegetables. Stem lettuce, widely consumed in China, is eaten either raw or cooked, the latter primarily in soups and stir-frys.",36607.0,Lettuce,95.jpg,image/jpeg,96800.0,2012-04-20 09:34:18 UTC,102.0,Vegetables,Leaf vegetables,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:20 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:24 UTC,,,False,specific,4236.0,True,,,,,,2.0,,,,6.0,,,,,31.5,76.5,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,48.5625,1170.0,1416.6666666666665,9748.745833333334,1040.5555555555554,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,2936.266,0.0,0.0,0.0,206297.10727,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,78612.962,1903.54638,,0.0,,,,,,,0.39,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,506.0,,,,0.0,0.003,,0.0,1.75,,0.0,,175513.90536999996,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,6817.921,14066.824400000001,37707.2,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,33407.137,,,,,,,,1490.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,4738.34,99.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,15449.0,2590.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.382,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,3300.09,0.0,193.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,15579.559,,0.0,6225.411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.494,,,,,,16539.49139,,16067.1335,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.05,,,,266.0,289.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,68460.006,,,,,,,0.134,0.0,56409.75,,0.0,0.0,20.702621,13.965643,22
85,97,Sweet bay,Laurus nobilis,"Laurus nobilis is an aromatic evergreen tree or large shrub with green, glossy leaves, native to the Mediterranean region. It is one of the plants used for bay leaf seasoning in cooking. It is known as bay laurel, sweet bay, bay tree (esp. United Kingdom), true laurel, Grecian laurel, laurel tree or simply laurel. Laurus nobilis figures prominently in classical Greek, Roman, and Biblical culture.The plant is the source of several popular herbs and one spice used in a wide variety of recipes, particularly among Mediterranean cuisines. Most commonly, the aromatic leaves are added whole to Italian pasta sauces. However, even when cooked, whole bay leaves can be sharp and abrasive enough to damage internal organs, so they are typically removed from dishes before serving, unless used as a simple garnish. Whole bay leaves have a long shelf life of about one year, under normal temperature and humidity.

Its flavor and smell is somewhat similar to celery. Lovage tea can be applied to wounds as an antiseptic, or drunk to stimulate digestion. The seeds can be used as a spice, similar to fennel seeds. In the UK, an alcoholic lovage cordial is traditionally mixed with brandy in the ratio of 2:1 as a winter drink. In Romania, the leaves are the preferred seasoning for the various local broths, much more so than parsley or dill.

89,101,Flaxseed,Linum usitatissimum,"Flax (also known as common flax or linseed) is a member of the genus Linum in the family Linaceae. It is a food and fibre crop that is grown in cooler regions of the world. Flax fibres are taken from the stem of the plant and are two to three times as strong as those of cotton. As well, flax fibres are naturally smooth and straight. Europe and North America depended on flax for cloth until the nineteenth century, when cotton overtook flax as the most common plant used for making linen paper. Flax is grown on the Canadian Praires for linseed oil, which is used as a drying oil in paints and varnish and in products such as linoleum and printing inks. It is native to the region extending from the eastern Mediterranean to India and was probably first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent. Flax was extensively cultivated in ancient Ethiopia and ancient Egypt. A discovery reported in 2009 of spun, dyed, and knotted wild flax fibers in a prehistoric cave in the Republic of Georgia shows that the plant was already in use by humans at the surprisingly early date of 30,000 B.C. New Zealand flax is not related to flax but was named after it, as both plants are used to produce fibers.",29226.0,Flax,101.jpg,image/jpeg,106535.0,2012-04-20 09:44:20 UTC,108.0,Herbs and Spices,Oilseed crops,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:20 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:24 UTC,,,False,specific,4006.0,True,,4.0,0.0,58.5,0.0,47.0,20.5,19327.5,59.0,15377.333333333334,24.5,,67.5,,12004.0,41703.666666666664,,0.0,33.5,24.0,79.0,20.5,99.5,0.0,,103.66666666666667,17.5,12.5,24.333333333333332,14.0,0.0,45.666666666666664,19.0,0.0,2203.625,6256.666666666667,11325.0,23676.666666666668,53077.777777777774,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,11520.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16431.25,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.046,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.171,0.0,,3090.0,74830.0,,0.0,,,,,,,225.7,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,6210.0,,0.0,,18806.691,0.0,0.0,,6.161,0.0,0.0,76.0,0.0,0.0011,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,1810.0,,,,,,,,1173.915,0.0,32.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,329.0,100.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,614.436,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.312,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,111.11,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,29130.19,,0.0,3280.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00035,,,,,,42426.092000000004,,1609.2,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,723.0079,,,,507.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,830.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,179.0,,0.0,0.0,-11.123208,-13.967344,14

91,105,Apple,Malus pumila,"The apple is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree, species Malus domestica in the rose family. It is one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits, and the most widely known of the many members of genus Malus that are used by humans. Apples grow on small, deciduous trees. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have been present in the mythology and religions of many cultures, including Norse, Greek and Christian traditions. In 2010, the fruit's genome was decoded, leading to new understandings of disease control and selective breeding in apple production. There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including in cooking, fresh eating and cider production. Domestic apples are generally propagated by grafting, although wild apples grow readily from seed. Trees are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. About 69Œæmillion tonnes of apples were grown worldwide in 2010, and China produced almost half of this total. The United States is the second-leading producer, with more than 6% of world production. Turkey is third, followed by Italy, India and Poland. Apples are often eaten raw, but can also be found in many prepared foods (especially desserts) and drinks. Many beneficial health effects have been found from eating apples; however, two forms of allergies are seen to various proteins found in the fruit.",25262.0,Apple,105.jpg,image/jpeg,86997.0,2012-04-20 09:44:31 UTC,112.0,Fruits,Pomes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:20 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:24 UTC,,,False,specific,283210.0,True,,5.0,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,,,15.6,,,,,57.28,12.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,257.7931034482759,306.53846153846155,2384.782608695652,33300.64102564102,3935.6388888888887,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,1916.0159999999998,0.0,0.0,,0.0,97505.87999999999,0.0,0.0,374.0,705070.76896,,0.0,0.0,627.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2222.4181,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.389,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,1003.241,0.2,0.0,,209056.09699999998,93979.164,,0.0,,,,,,,42136.042,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,10820.31708,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,211.0,,1340.0,1955.62081,721597.1087900001,0.0,0.0,,886.0,0.0,0.0,24723.085,9145.577999999998,44186.10783,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,331044.9713600001,,,,,1800.19,,,34873.571299999996,0.0,4541.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,64857.731999999996,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,493.07,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,71518.96100000001,875.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,82.0334,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.002,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,48369.2103,1311.4012,7865.102999999999,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,22.1,,,,,,0.0,218956.4112,,0.0,34797.251000000004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,771.0,,,,,,155038.63856,,114103.32400000001,,,,0.3,1.17,,0.0,,0.184,,0.0,,160.112,,,,218.38607,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,1701.101,,,,,,,591.36,0.0,50860.0,,76.0,0.0,30.668268,25.98459,12

94,112,Spearmint,Mentha spicata,"Spearmint or spear mint (Mentha spicata) is a species of mint native to much of Europe and southwest Asia, though its exact natural range is uncertain due to extensive early cultivation.Spearmint grows well in nearly all temperate climates. Gardeners often grow it in pots or planters due to its invasive, spreading rhizomes. The plant prefers partial shade, but can flourish in full sun to mostly shade. Spearmint is best suited to loamy soils with abundant organic material.Spearmint leaves can be used fresh, dried, or frozen. They can also be preserved in salt, sugar, sugar syrup, alcohol, or oil. The leaves lose their aromatic appeal after the plant flowers. It can be dried by cutting just before, or right (at peak) as the flowers open, about one-half to three-quarters the way down the stalk (leaving smaller shoots room to grow). Some dispute exists as to what drying method works best; some prefer different materials (such as plastic or cloth) and different lighting conditions (such as darkness or sunlight).Spearmint is often cultivated for its aromatic and carminative oil, referred to as oil of spearmint. The most abundant compound in spearmint oil is R-(?)-carvone, which gives spearmint its distinctive smell. Spearmint oil also contains significant amounts of limonene, dihydrocarvone, and 1,8-cineol. Unlike peppermint oil, oil of spearmint contains minimal amounts of menthol and menthone. It is used as a flavoring for toothpaste and confectionery, and is sometimes added to shampoos and soaps.",32272.0,Spearmint,112.jpg,image/jpeg,90563.0,2012-04-20 09:30:01 UTC,119.0,Herbs and Spices,Herbs,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:20 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:24 UTC,,,False,specific,29719.0,True,,,,,,9.0,,,,102.5,,,,,250.0,1565.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,426.25,11610.0,18300.0,31820.0,2722.35,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,227.0,,,,404.0,5320.456,0.0,0.0,,0.0,6093.0,0.0,12.0,0.0,72398.19209000001,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2373.08918,,,,,,18.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,59.0,2197.0,0.0,,2158.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,1400.0,3098.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,5.8132,,30317.610800000002,26.0,0.0,,345.0,0.0,0.0,879.0,2260.0088,961.001,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,178.0,,222.0,,,16027.074,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1995.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,1139.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,28306.237000000005,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,506.007,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,2405.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,77.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,1295.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,2654.0,,0.0,2596.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1800.0,,,,,,0.0,,5007.0,,,,5.0,0.0,,829.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.19,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,431.0,0.0,0.0,0.54,,0.0,0.0,13.304327,-8.16498,14
95,113,Peppermint,Mentha X piperita,"Peppermint (Mentha í„ piperita, also known as M. balsamea Willd.) is a hybrid mint, a cross between watermint and spearmint. The plant, indigenous to Europe, is now widespread in cultivation throughout all regions of the world. It is found wild occasionally with its parent species. Fresh or dried peppermint leaves are often used alone or with other herbs in herbal teas (tisanes, infusions). Peppermint is used for flavouring ice cream, confectionery, chewing gum, and toothpaste, and can also be found in some shampoos, soaps and skin care products. Menthol activates cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors in the skin and mucosal tissues, and is the primary source of the cooling sensation that follows the topical application of peppermint oil. Peppermint has a high menthol content. The oil also contains menthone and carboxyl esters, particularly menthyl acetate. Dried peppermint typically has 0.3äóñ0.4% of volatile oil containing menthol (7äóñ48%), menthone (20äóñ46%), menthyl acetate (3äóñ10%), menthofuran (1äóñ17%) and 1,8-cineol (3äóñ6%). Peppermint oil also contains small amounts of many additional compounds including limonene, pulegone, caryophyllene and pinene.

98,118,Nutmeg,Myristica fragrans,"The nutmeg tree is any of several species of trees in genus Myristica. The most important commercial species is Myristica fragrans, an evergreen tree indigenous to the Banda Islands in the Moluccas (or Spice Islands) of Indonesia.The nutmeg tree is important for two spices derived from the fruit: nutmeg and mace.Nutmeg is the seed of the tree, roughly egg-shaped and about 20 to 30 mm (0.8 to 1.2 in) long and 15 to 18 mm (0.6 to 0.7 in) wide, and weighing between 5 and 10 g (0.2 and 0.4 oz) dried, while mace is the dried ""lacy"" reddish covering or aril of the seed. The first harvest of nutmeg trees takes place 7-9 years after planting, and the trees reach full production after twenty years. Nutmeg is usually used in powdered form. This is the only tropical fruit that is the source of two different spices. Several other commercial products are also produced from the trees, including essential oils, extracted oleoresins, and nutmeg butter .The common or fragrant nutmeg, Myristica fragrans, native to the Banda Islands of Indonesia, is also grown in Penang Island in Malaysia and the Caribbean, especially in Grenada. It also grows in Kerala, a state in southern India. Other species of nutmeg include Papuan nutmeg M. argentea from New Guinea, and M. malabarica from India.In low doses, nutmeg produces no noticeable physiological or neurological response, but in large doses, raw nutmeg has psychoactive effects.[citation needed] In its freshly ground form (from whole nutmegs), nutmeg contains myristicin, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and psychoactive substance.[citation needed] Myristicin poisoning can induce convulsions, palpitations, nausea, eventual dehydration, and generalized body pain.

It is a half-hardy annual plant, best known as a culinary herb prominently featured in Italian cuisine, and also plays a major role in Southeast Asian cuisines of Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and the cuisine of Taiwan. Depending on the species and cultivar, the leaves may taste somewhat like anise, with a strong, pungent, often sweet smell.There are many varieties of Ocimum basilicum, as well as several related species or species hybrids also called basil.

X citriodorum) and holy basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum), which are used in Asia. While most common varieties of basil are treated as annuals, some are perennial in warm, tropical climates, including holy basil and a cultivar known as 'African Blue'.",32627.0,Sweet_basil,119.jpg,image/jpeg,147279.0,2012-04-20 09:39:30 UTC,126.0,Herbs and Spices,Herbs,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:21 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:24 UTC,,,False,specific,39350.0,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,85.5,0.0,1067.0,0.0,577.5,,,,,136.0,308.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,331.5,13065.0,19650.0,29600.0,3163.3,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,701.24,0.0,0.0,,0.0,294.12,0.0,0.0,0.0,12356.2264,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,7002.027,,,,,0.06,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,927.0,0.0,,191.0,319.0,,0.0,,,,,,25.0,64.0,1486.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,261.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.023,,983.0,,10518.072999999999,0.0,0.0,,618.0,0.0,0.0,423.0,1844.7581,8711.059000000001,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,1394.0,,,,,0.28500000000000003,,,23174.505,2367.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,758.0,1.05,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.595,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,2397.0,,0.0,,1401.018,18191.2147,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,843.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,11671.23,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.475,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,1317.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,1226.473,,0.0,1303.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4086.0,,,,,,5088.0,,2034.0,,,,,0.0,,3412.0,,0.0,,0.0,,12.497,,,,1e-05,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,1805.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,31571.0,,0.0,0.0,-22.025105,-17.307623,14

101,121,Olive,Olea europaea,"The olive is the fruit of the olive tree (Olea europaea, meaning ""Oil from/of Europe"").  It is an important food crop in countries around the Mediterranean Sea, and places with a Mediterranean climate. The olive is of major agricultural importance in the Mediterranean region as the source of olive oil; it is one of the three core ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine. About 90% of all harvested olives are turned into oil, while about 10% are used as table olives. Table olives are classified into three groups according to the degree of ripeness achieved before harvesting:(1) Green olives are picked when they have obtained full size, but before the ripening cycle has begun; they are usually shades of green to yellow. (2) Semiripe or turning-colour olives are picked at the beginning of the ripening cycle, when the colour has begun to change from green to multicolour shades of red to brown. Only the skin is coloured, as the flesh of the fruit lacks pigmentation at this stage, unlike that of ripe olives. (3) Black olives or ripe olives are picked at full maturity when fully ripe. They are found in assorted shades of purple to brown to black.Olives are a rich source of vitamin E (25% of the Daily Value, DV), and contain a large amount of sodium (104% DV); other nutrients are insignificant. Green olives are 75% water, 15% fat, 4% carbohydrates and 1% protein. The polyphenol composition of olive fruits varies during fruit ripening and during processing by fermentation when olives are immersed whole in brine or crushed to produce oil. In raw fruit, total polyphenol contents, as measured by the Folin method, are 117 mg/100 g in black olives and 161 mg/100 g in green olives, compared to 55 and 21 mg/100 g for extra virgin and virgin olive oil, respectively. Olive fruit contains several types of polyphenols, mainly tyrosols, phenolic acids, flavonols and flavones, and for black olives, anthocyanins. The main bitter flavor of olives before curing results from oleuropein and its aglycone which total in content, respectively, 72 and 82 mg/100 g in black olives, and 56 and 59 mg/100 g in green olives. Polyphenol content also varies with olive cultivar (Spanish Manzanillo highest) and the manner of presentation, with plain olives having higher contents than those that are pitted or stuffed [Wikipedia].",32990.0,Olive,121.jpg,image/jpeg,1384481.0,2012-04-20 09:36:03 UTC,128.0,Vegetables,Fruit vegetables,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:21 UTC,2017-06-23 18:21:50 UTC,,,False,specific,4146.0,True,,0.0,,,,379.75,125.0,,,23794.5,,,,,3092.0,239.5,,0.0,102.5,,,,,0.0,,129.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1046.0,710.0,2437.5,16079.791666666666,30755.833333333332,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,1772.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,4583.00311,0.0,0.0,0.0,27741.941749999994,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,197685.9214,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,6088.0,246.0,0.0,,1810.0,21034.4,,0.0,,,,,,,141.035,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,261.0,,177223.89549000002,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,124.253,7300.70301,39828.005,0.0,,0.0,,788.0063799999999,,,0.0,,9130.0,,,,,0.09,,,4213.0965,0.001,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,4505.0,0.35,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,5260.003000000001,9861.9,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,40059.086,,,0.0,1119.074,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,595.0013799999999,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,12454.0,,0.0,5247.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,51880.981999999996,,104075.01468,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,83.0,0.0,,,,0.004,,,0.0,,,7632.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,5839.290400000001,,0.0,0.0,1.7524966,17.835798,22

103,124,Common oregano,Origanum vulgare,"Oregano (scientific name Origanum vulgare) is a common species of Origanum, a genus of the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is native to warm-temperate western and southwestern Eurasia and the Mediterranean region.Oregano is an important culinary herb, used for the flavour of its leaves, which can be more flavourful when dried than fresh. It has an aromatic, warm and slightly bitter taste, which can vary in intensity. Good quality oregano may be strong enough almost to numb the tongue, but the cultivars adapted to colder climates often have a lesser flavor. Factors such as climate, seasons and soil composition may affect the aromatic oils present, and this effect may be greater than the differences between the various species of plants. Among the chemical compounds contributing to the flavour are carvacrol, thymol, limonene, pinene, ocimene, and caryophyllene",32632.0,Oregano,124.jpg,image/jpeg,45859.0,2012-04-20 09:28:53 UTC,131.0,Herbs and Spices,Herbs,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:21 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:24 UTC,,,False,specific,39352.0,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,4.0,0.0,712.0,0.0,712.0,,,,,748.0,621.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,686.0,9000.0,42500.0,67915.275,7488.5,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1435.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16342.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2243.016,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,1626.0,1735.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.486,1443.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,379.0,,19199.12209,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,398.53000000000003,36481.720400000006,865.055,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,5958.0,,,,,300.0,,,9881.917000000001,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,481.0,0.7,,,0.0,0.0,,,379.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,2552.0,1587.394,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,424.1,0.0,1185.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,1807.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,397.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,654.0,,0.0,378.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,32921.0,,2846.0,,,,,0.0,,133.0,,0.0,,0.0,,259.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,390.0,,,,,,228.0,0.0,0.0,212.0,,0.0,0.0,-16.100956,-30.824419,14
104,125,Rice,Oryza sativa,"Rice is the seed of the monocot plants Oryza sativa (Asian rice) or Oryza glaberrima (African rice). As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia and the West Indies. It is the grain with the second-highest worldwide production, after maize (corn), according to data for 2010. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by the human species. Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,200äóñ13,500 years ago, in the Pearl River valley region of China. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China. From East Asia, rice spread to Southeast and South Asia. Rice was introduced to Europe through Western Asia, and to the Americas through European colonization. There are many varieties of rice and culinary preferences tend to vary regionally. In the Far East, there is a preference for softer and stickier varieties. Because of its importance as a staple food, rice has considerable cultural importance. Rice is often directly associated with prosperity and fertility. Therefore, there is the custom of throwing rice at weddings. Rice is normally grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can survive as a perennial and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years. The rice plant can grow to 1äóñ1.8Œæm tall, occasionally more depending on the variety and soil fertility. It has long, slender leaves 50äóñ100Œæcm long and 2äóñ2.5Œæcm broad. The small wind-pollinated flowers are produced in a branched arching to pendulous inflorescence 30äóñ50Œæcm long. The edible seed is a grain 5äóñ12Œæmm long and 2äóñ3Œæmm thick. Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. Rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide. The traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound planning and servicing of the water damming and channeling, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters vermin. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil. The name wild rice is usually used for species of the grass genus Zizania, both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of Oryza.",41976.0,Rice,125.jpg,image/jpeg,102222.0,2012-04-20 09:34:03 UTC,132.0,Cereals and cereal products,Cereals,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:21 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:24 UTC,,,False,specific,4530.0,True,,0.0,,,,10.6875,,,,1725.5625,,,,,1517.6875,80.75,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,774.8243243243244,4920.30303030303,2947.4537037037035,65598.61742424243,3364.9494949494947,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,127.47739999999999,0.0,0.0,,0.0,41330.06540000001,4680.0,0.0,0.0,567093.14003,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,773.22434,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,32849.25803,2073.9173,,0.0,,,,,,,212.134,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,21.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,138.0,,0.0,,390515.77593000006,0.0,0.0,,0.224,0.0,0.0,0.0,3060.0,300.33799999999997,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,160733.028,,,,,,,,4037.3820000000005,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,14391.19,0.064,,,0.0,0.0,,,32.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.141,,21773.218,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,340.0,0.0,1.281,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,1.21,,99.0,,,0.0,585.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,230.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,19791.5626,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,301.0,,,,,,0.0,21211.346999999998,,0.0,14457.751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,374.0,,,,,,195499.206,,33261.22575000001,,,,,112.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,361.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,8e-05,,,7378.01,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,23.0,,0.0,0.0,29.388437,22.149216,5
105,126,Millet,Panicum miliaceum,"The millets are a group of highly variable small-seeded grasses, widely grown around the world as cereal crops or grains for both human food and fodder. They do not form a taxonomic group, but rather a functional or agronomic one. Millets are important crops in the semi-arid tropics of Asia and Africa, with 97% of millet production in developing countries. The crop is favored due to its productivity and short growing season under dry, high temperature conditions. The most widely grown millet is pearl millet, which is an important crop in India and parts of Africa. Finger millet, proso millet, and foxtail millet are also important crop species. In the developed world, millets are less important. For example, in the United States the only significant crop is proso millet, which is mostly grown for bird seed. While millets are indigenous to many parts of the world, millets most likely had an evolutionary origin in tropical western Africa, as that is where the greatest number of both wild and cultivated forms exist. Millets have been important food staples in human history, particularly in Asia and Africa, and they have been in cultivation in East Asia for the last 10,000 years.",40946.0,Millet,126.jpg,image/jpeg,89513.0,2012-04-20 09:39:45 UTC,133.0,Cereals and cereal products,Cereals,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:21 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:24 UTC,,,False,specific,4540.0,True,,2.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,9.25,0.0,895.0,0.0,624.0,0.0,,3.0,,1729.0,75.0,,0.0,16.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.666666666666667,,15.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,941.6,9570.0,4625.0,67914.16666666667,3483.75,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,12082.00179,0.0,0.0,0.0,25112.5945,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,20801.0,2313.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,204253.42599999998,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,54237.810000000005,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1747.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,13471.008,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,4770.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,67184.0,,0.0,6262.011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,27105.5,,15444.244499999999,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,57.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1142.0,,0.0,0.0,8.434042,16.740322,5
106,127,Poppy,Papaver,"The Poppy is an Angiospermae or flowering plant of the family Papaveraceae. Ornamental poppies are grown for their colorful flowers; some varieties of poppy are used as food, whilst other varieties produce the powerful medicinal alkaloid opium which has been used since ancient times to create analgesic and narcotic medicinal and recreational drugs. Following the trench warfare of the 1st World War which took place in the poppy fields of Flanders, red poppies have become a symbol of remembrance of soldiers who have died during wartime. Poppy flowers have 4 to 6 petals, many stamens forming a conspicuous whorl in the center of the flower and an ovary consisting of from 2 to many fused carpels. Poppies can grow to be over 4 feet tall, and 6 inches across. (Simon, Chadwick, and Craker 1984) The petals are showy, may be of almost any color and some have markings. The petals are crumpled in the bud and as blooming finishes, the petals often lie flat before falling away. The poppy will become dormant after blooming. Poppies are in full bloom late spring to early summer. (Simon, Chadwick, and Craker 1984) Most species secrete latex when injured. The pollen of the oriental poppy, Papaver orientale, is dark blue. The Papaver Somniferum poppy is mainly grown in Eastern and Southern Asia, and South Eastern Europe. It is believed that it originated in the Mediterranean region. (Jonsson and Krzymanski, 1989) The pollen of the field poppy or corn poppy (Papaver rhoeas) is dark green to grey. Bees use poppies as a pollen source. Poppies belong to genera of Papaveraceae, which includes: Papaver äóñ corn poppy, Opium poppy, Oriental poppy, Iceland poppy, and about 120 other species Eschscholzia äóñ California poppy and relatives Meconopsis äóñ Welsh poppy, Nepal poppy, and relatives Stylophorum äóñ Celandine poppy or wood poppy Argemone äóñ Prickly poppy Romneya äóñ Matilija poppy and relatives Canbya äóñ Pygmy poppy Stylomecon äóñ Wind poppy Arctomecon äóñ desert bearpaw poppy Hunnemannia äóñ Tulip poppy Dendromecon äóñ Tree poppy",18881.0,Poppy,127.jpg,image/jpeg,190654.0,2012-04-20 09:43:00 UTC,134.0,Herbs and Spices,Oilseed crops,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:21 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:24 UTC,,,False,specific,3468.0,True,,,,,,0.0,,,,19700.0,,,,,62400.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,2285.3333333333335,0.0,5000.0,12466.666666666666,72350.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,11.066,0.0,0.0,0.0,4398.786,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,510.55,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,16021.21815,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,1930.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,6.029999999999999,15.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,1270.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,140.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,116.000183,,0.0,116.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,840.0,,14419.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,4100.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,170.0,,0.0,0.0,-7.3974237,-13.698888,14

111,132,Scarlet bean,Phaseolus coccineus,"Phaseolus coccineus, known as runner bean, scarlet runner bean, or multiflora bean, is a plant in the Fabaceae family. Runner beans have also been called ""Oregon Lima Bean"", and in Nahuatl ""ayocotl"" or in Spanish ""ayocote"". It differs from the common bean (P. vulgaris) in several respects: the cotyledons stay in the ground during germination, and the plant is a perennial vine with tuberous roots (though it is usually treated as an annual). This species originated from the mountains of Central America. Most varieties have red flowers and multicolored seeds (though some have white flowers and white seeds), and they are often grown as ornamental plants.The vine can grow to two meters (6 feet) or more in length. The green pods are edible whole before they become fibrous, and the seeds can be used fresh or as dried beans.The starchy roots are still eaten by Central American Indians. In the UK, the flowers are often ignored, or treated as an attractive bonus to cultivating the plant for the beans, whereas in the US the scarlet runner is widely grown for its attractive flowers by people who would never think of eating it.

114,135,Date,Phoenix dactylifera,"Phoenix dactylifera (date, or date palm) is a palm in the genus Phoenix, cultivated for its edible sweet fruit. The fruit is known as a date. The fruit's English name (through Old French), as well as the Latin species name dactylifera, both come from the Greek word for ""finger"", díçktulos, because of the fruit's elongated shape. Dates are oval-cylindrical, 3?7 cm long, and 2?3 cm (0.79?1.18 in) diameter, and when ripe, range from bright red to bright yellow in colour, depending on variety. Dates contain a single stone about 2?2.5 cm (0.79?0.98 in) long and 6?8 mm (0.24?0.31 in) thick. Three main cultivar groups of date exist: soft (e.g. 'Barhee', 'Halawy', 'Khadrawy', 'Medjool'), semi-dry (e.g. 'Dayri', 'Deglet Noor', 'Zahdi'), and dry (e.g. 'Thoory'). The type of fruit depends on the glucose, fructose and sucrose content.Dry or soft dates are eaten out-of-hand, or may be pitted and stuffed with fillings such as almonds, walnuts, pecans, candied orange and lemon peel, tahini, marzipan or cream cheese.",42458.0,Date_(fruit)#Dates,135.jpg,image/jpeg,126473.0,2012-04-20 09:38:15 UTC,143.0,Fruits,Other fruits,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:22 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:25 UTC,,,False,specific,42345.0,True,,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,,,35.0,,,,,16.0,3.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,854.8,2130.0,6875.0,77747.5,1873.3333333333333,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,320.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1916.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,111077.38000000002,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.29,0.0,,14307.56702,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,33024.204,844.0,,0.0,,,,,,,5200.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,120.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,962.1,,7700.009,,63085.09669,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4560.6,1900.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,3673.6960000000004,,,,,38038.0,,,5177.17707,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,55.1,60.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,162.36499999999998,0.5,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,75.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,1300.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0014,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,12956.0,,0.0,1016.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08,,,,,,3132.0343,,946.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,410.0,,,,1500.0,0.4,,,,,,,0.0,,,1171.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,36500.0,0.0,14.1978855,1.1045649,12

117,139,Pepper (Spice),Piper nigrum,"Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae, cultivated for its fruit, which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning. The fruit, known as a peppercorn when dried, is approximately 5 millimetres in diameter, dark red when fully mature, and, like all drupes, contains a single seed. Peppercorns, and the ground pepper derived from them, may be described simply as pepper, or more precisely as black pepper (cooked and dried unripe fruit), green pepper (dried unripe fruit) and white pepper (dried ripe seeds). Black pepper is native to south India, and is extensively cultivated there and elsewhere in tropical regions. Currently Vietnam is the world's largest producer and exporter of pepper, producing 34% of the world's Piper nigrum crop as of 2008. Dried ground pepper has been used since antiquity for both its flavour and as a medicine. Black pepper is the world's most traded spice. It is one of the most common spices added to European cuisine and its descendants. The spiciness of black pepper is due to the chemical piperine, not to be confused with the capsaicin that gives fleshy peppers theirs. It is ubiquitous in the modern world, often paired with salt.",18310.0,Black pepper,139.jpg,image/jpeg,165046.0,2012-04-20 09:36:32 UTC,147.0,Herbs and Spices,Spices,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:22 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:25 UTC,,2.0,False,specific,13216.0,True,0.0,16.0,0.0,,,77.0,0.0,647.0,0.0,647.0,,,,,694.0,152.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,152.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,822.6,10395.0,26125.0,61647.5,3795.6666666666665,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.02,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,10501.06,0.0,0.0,0.0,12839.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,1508.432,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.85,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,1447.0007,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2479.0,14787.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,8769.737000000001,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.00157,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1620.0,,81.0,0.077,97404.98000000001,0.0,0.0,1610.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,269.0,12891.351999999999,3568.31,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,22868.0,,,,,,,,46362.7694,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1156.0,0.057,,,0.0,0.0,,,1438.7199999999998,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1281.96,,0.0,,711.0,96130.291,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,96.286,,,0.0,286.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,10469.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,5152.0,,0.0,2370.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5000.0,,,,,,12227.0,,5454.0,,,,,0.0,,8797.063,,0.0,,0.0,,20100.005,,,,,0.0,,,,,,4.99,0.0,,,791.0,,,,,,69.9,0.0,0.0,420.0,,0.0,0.0,1.3658241,5.8480983,14

The tree produces an important culinary nut. Pistacia vera often is confused with other species in the genus Pistacia that are also known as pistachio. These species can be distinguished from P. vera by their geographic distributions (in the wild) and their nuts which are much smaller, have a strong flavor of turpentine, and have a shell that is not hard.",506470.0,Pistachio,140.jpg,image/jpeg,83025.0,2012-04-20 09:30:19 UTC,148.0,Nuts,Nuts,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:22 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:25 UTC,,,False,specific,55513.0,True,0.0,3.3333333333333335,9.0,,,461.0,19.0,,0.0,23075.333333333332,,,0.0,,13295.666666666666,245.0,,0.0,162.66666666666666,0.0,,,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,,40.666666666666664,,,3.3333333333333335,,0.0,0.0,42.0,0.0,1700.125,20723.333333333332,10166.666666666668,24080.266666666666,47359.5,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,3230.725,0.0,0.0,0.0,89566.6203,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,64.66,86.001,,0.0,,,,,,,309.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,17148.0,,0.0,,36662.0734,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1342.004,1708.037,3909.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,31356.7236,,,,,404.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,413.37,0.39,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,529.6,0.0012,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,1571.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,1782.1280000000002,,0.0,1163.0005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,2221.6040000000003,,17260.214999999997,,,,0.00409,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,3771.081,,,,267.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,2750.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1051.0,,0.0,0.0,18.053907,-3.3314936,16
119,141,Common pea,Pisum sativum,"The pea is most commonly the small spherical seed or the seed-pod of the pod fruit Pisum sativum. Each pod contains several peas. Peapods are botanically a fruit, since they contain seeds developed from the ovary of a (pea) flower. However, peas are considered to be a vegetable in cooking. The name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae such as the pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), the cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and the seeds from several species of Lathyrus. P. sativum is an annual plant, with a life cycle of one year. It is a cool season crop grown in many parts of the world; planting can take place from winter to early summer depending on location. The average pea weighs between 0.1 and 0.36Œægrams. The immature peas (and in snow peas the tender pod as well) are used as a vegetable, fresh, frozen or canned; varieties of the species typically called field peas are grown to produce dry peas like the split pea shelled from the matured pod. These are the basis of pease porridge and pea soup, staples of medieval cuisine; in Europe, consuming fresh immature green peas was an innovation of Early Modern cuisine. The wild pea is restricted to the Mediterranean basin and the Near East. The earliest archaeological finds of peas date from the neolithic era of current Syria, Turkey and Jordan. In Egypt, early finds date from ca. 4800äóñ4400ŒæBC in the Nile delta area, and from ca. 3800äóñ3600ŒæBC in Upper Egypt. The pea was also present in Georgia in the 5th millennium BC. Farther east, the finds are younger. Peas were present in Afghanistan ca. 2000ŒæBC, in Harappa, Pakistan, and in northwest India in 2250äóñ1750ŒæBC. In the second half of the 2nd millennium BC, this pulse crop appears in the Gangetic basin and southern India.",26867.0,Pea,141.jpg,image/jpeg,37409.0,2012-04-20 09:29:56 UTC,150.0,Pulses,Peas,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:22 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:25 UTC,,,True,specific,3888.0,True,,,,,,0.0,,,,47.833333333333336,,,,,160.45833333333334,34.958333333333336,,0.0,1.0666666666666667,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,245.62264150943398,5726.666666666667,5430.0,23892.495833333334,1094.7666666666667,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.037,33811.941,0.0,0.0,83.0,767865.8174899999,,0.0,0.0,,,,,75.0,0.0,0.0,,13530.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,17.0,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.003,,52735.394100000005,70291.0,,0.074,74990.0,,,,6970.0,,4102.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,10.049019999999999,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.065,,0.0,,296934.47753,0.0,0.0,,1925.0,0.0,4997.0,5139.923999999999,29170.0,17669.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,127377.16345,,,,,,,,51973.038,0.0,0.332,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,141.0,494.0,48403.059,11260.0008,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,17576.24508,0.114,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,1.0,9.442,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,73.0,,,,3.695,,,72.0,,,0.0,4.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,9186.132000000001,11006.0,519.166,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,36155.23674000001,,0.0,110848.5692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,,,,,,84422.89866,,151537.00148,,,,,0.0536,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0034,,4.88,,,,1359.0,0.0,,,,0.0098,,,0.0,,,19886.146,,,,,,,2167.0,0.0,8471.0,,0.792,0.0,31.354239,21.759035,17

129,151,Pomegranate,Punica granatum,"The pomegranate, scientific name Punica granatum, is a fruit-bearing deciduous shrub or small tree growing between 5äóñ8 metres tall. Native to an area from the eastern Mediterranean Basin to India, the pomegranate has been cultivated over millennia, including today throughout the Mediterranean, Middle East and Caucasus regions, northern Africa and tropical Africa, the Indian subcontinent and the drier parts of southeast Asia. Introduced into Latin America and California by Spanish settlers in 1769, pomegranate is also cultivated in parts of California and Arizona. In the Northern Hemisphere, the fruit is typically in season from September to February. In the Southern Hemisphere, the pomegranate is in season from March to May.

132,154,Garden rhubarb,Rheum rhabarbarum,"Rheum rhabarbarum, Rhubarb is a species of plant in the family Polygonaceae. They are herbaceous perennials growing from short, thick rhizomes. They have large leaves that are somewhat triangular, with long fleshy petioles. They have small flowers grouped in large compound leafy greenish-white to rose-red inflorescences. In culinary use, fresh raw petioles (leaf stalks) are crisp (similar to celery) with a strong, tart taste. Most commonly, the plant's leaf stalks are cooked with sugar and used in pies and other desserts. A number of varieties have been domesticated for human consumption, most of which are recognised as Rheum x hybridum by the Royal Horticultural Society. Rhubarb is usually considered to be a vegetable; however, in the United States, a New York court decided in 1947 that since it was used in the United States as a fruit, it was to be counted as a fruit for the purposes of regulations and duties. A side effect was a reduction on imported rhubarb tariffs, as tariffs were higher for vegetables than fruits. Rhubarb also contains glycosides especially rhein, glucorhein and emodin which impart cathartic and laxative activities to it. It is hence useful as a cathartic in case of constipation.

139,161,Cloudberry,Rubus chamaemorus,"Rubus chamaemorus (Greek chamai ""on the ground"", moros ""mulberry"") is a rhizomatous herb native to alpine and arctic tundra and boreal forest, producing amber-colored edible fruit similar to the raspberry or blackberry. English common names include cloudberry, bakeapple (in Atlantic Canada), knotberry and knoutberry (in England), aqpik or low-bush salmonberry (in Alaska - not to be confused with true salmonberry, Rubus spectabilis), and averin or evron (in Scotland).Unlike most Rubus species, the cloudberry is dioecious, and fruit production by a female plant requires pollination from a male plant.The cloudberry grows to 10?25 cm high. The leaves alternate between having 5 and 7 soft, handlike lobes on straight, branchless stalks. After pollination, the white (sometimes reddish-tipped) flowers form raspberry-sized berries. Encapsulating between 5 and 25 drupelets, each fruit is initially pale red, ripening into an amber color in early autumn.",24850.0,Cloudberry,161.jpg,image/jpeg,363974.0,2012-04-20 09:34:45 UTC,171.0,Fruits,Berries,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:23 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:25 UTC,,,False,specific,57936.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,132.5,2400.0,,8600.0,800.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,228.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.65,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.51,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.00235,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,31800.035,1734.63,0.16,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,14.0,,,87.0,0.0,972.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,1576.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,382.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,518.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,0.092,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-25.33138,-5.8883796,12

144,167,Summer savory,Satureja hortensis,"Summer savory (Satureja hortensis) is the better known of the savory species. It is an annual, but otherwise is similar in use and flavor to the perennial winter savory. It is used more often than winter savory, as winter savory is thought to have a slightly more bitter flavor.Summer savory is a traditional popular herb in Atlantic Canada, where it is used in the same way sage is elsewhere. It is the main flavoring in dressing for many fowl, mixed with ground pork and other basic ingredients to create a thick meat dressing known as ""cretonade"", which may be eaten with turkey, goose and duck. It also is used to make stews such as fricot, and in meat pies. It is usually available year-round in local grocery stores in dried form and is used in varying proportions, sometimes added to recipes in large generous heaping spoonfuls (such as in cretonade), and sometimes more subtly (as in beans, for which savory has a natural affinity). Summer savory is a characteristic ingredient of herbes de Provence, a fairly standard mixture of dried herbs sold in most French food stores. It is also widely used as a seasoning for grilled meats and barbecues, as well as in stews and sauces.",32308.0,Summer_savory,167.jpg,image/jpeg,111495.0,2012-04-20 09:33:36 UTC,177.0,Herbs and Spices,Herbs,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:23 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:25 UTC,,,False,specific,49987.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,705.0,6730.0,45700.0,72115.0,14473.75,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,143.5,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,425.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,30.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,2700.0,,0.455,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,159.0,,,142.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,1068.694,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,150.0,,0.0,438.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,278.0,,,,,,0.0,,2413.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-17.790018,-30.477814,14

146,170,Sesame,Sesamum orientale,"Sesame is a flowering plant in the genus Sesamum. Numerous wild relatives occur in Africa and a smaller number in India. It is widely naturalized in tropical regions around the world and is cultivated for its edible seeds, which grow in pods. Sesame seed is considered to be the oldest oilseed crop known, domesticated well over 5000 years ago. Sesame is very drought-tolerant. It has been called a survivor crop, with an ability to grow where most crops fail. Sesame has one of the highest oil contents of any seed. With a rich nutty flavor, it is a common ingredient in cuisines across the world. Sesame, like other nuts and foods, can trigger allergic reactions in some people. The world harvested about 3.84 million metric tonnes of sesame seeds in 2010. The largest producer of sesame seeds in 2010 was Burma.

150,175,Potato,Solanum tuberosum,"The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial Solanum tuberosum of the Solanaceae family (also known as the nightshades). The word may refer to the plant itself as well as the edible tuber. In the region of the Andes, there are some other closely related cultivated potato species. Potatoes were introduced outside the Andes region four centuries ago, and have become an integral part of much of the world's cuisine. It is the world's fourth-largest food crop, following rice, wheat and maize. Long-term storage of potatoes requires specialised care in cold warehouses. Wild potato species occur throughout the Americas, from the United States to southern Chile. The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated independently in multiple locations, but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species proved a single origin for potatoes in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia (from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex), where they were domesticated 7,000äóñ10,000 years ago. Following centuries of selective breeding, there are now over a thousand different types of potatoes. Of these subspecies, a variety that at one point grew in the Chiloí© Archipelago left its germplasm on over 99% of the cultivated potatoes worldwide. The annual diet of an average global citizen in the first decade of the 21st century included about 33Œækg of potato. However, the local importance of potato is extremely variable and rapidly changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe (especially eastern and central Europe), where per capita production is still the highest in the world, but the most rapid expansion over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia. China is now the world's largest potato-producing country, and nearly a third of the world's potatoes are harvested in China and India.",505272.0,Potato,175.jpg,image/jpeg,135158.0,2012-04-20 09:33:45 UTC,185.0,Vegetables,Tubers,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:24 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:25 UTC,,,True,specific,4113.0,True,0.0,4.111111111111111,0.04,81.125,2.625,24.25,5.68,4838.727272727273,431.72727272727275,2053.25,18.625,,109.0,56.5,947.325,104.63513513513513,,1.148936170212766,23.807692307692307,3.1923076923076925,0.375,3.375,1.1538461538461537,0.20754716981132076,0.0,22.928571428571427,0.9,0.625,0.2978723404255319,1.2,0.20408163265306123,2.6,31.666666666666668,0.0,472.8238636363636,2855.121951219512,3525.7716049382716,42078.67886178862,4724.281842818428,0.0,,328.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,69691.0,0.0,0.0,,59419.2272,194863.84974,0.0,1420.0,0.0,1200528.0724799992,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0262,0.0,0.0,,289.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,518.0,273.55,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,6040.0,0.0,,106302.635,90958.8025,,0.0,,,,474.0,,,483.025,,0.0,,,,,4420.0,,,948.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,8551.2325,,3920.0,0.0,1790095.3582299994,0.0,0.0,,2096.984,0.0,0.0,3634.2,619.6959999999999,671.6611,0.0,,0.8,,,0.0091,,972.0,,360072.3766,,374.0,,,479.0,,,11379.301,222.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.187,,0.0,0.0,32064.200299999997,60.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,24.64,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,21025.7285,657.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,14424.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.09,,,536.0640000000001,,,305.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,17453.899699999998,1820.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,,,,,512.0,0.0,245215.60107,,0.0,131445.34260000003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,59.0,,,,,,120460.87387,,127908.37880000002,,,,,0.0,,1529.0,,0.0,,0.0,8803.7639,86327.87,,,,3000.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,17802.75757,0.0,,,,,,70.0,0.0,122.0,,345.167,0.0,33.40664,31.327244,22

They are native to Eurasia and North and South America, and two species, T. officinale and T. erythrospermum, are found as weeds worldwide. Both species are edible in their entirety. The common name dandelion (from French dent-de-lion, meaning ""lion's tooth"") is given to members of the genus, and like other members of the Asteraceae family, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is called a floret. Many Taraxacum species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.",36213.0,Dandelion,181.jpg,image/jpeg,386051.0,2012-04-20 09:37:01 UTC,192.0,Herbs and Spices,Herbs,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:24 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:25 UTC,,,False,specific,50225.0,True,,,,,,0.0,,,,13.0,,,,,242.5,41.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,111.71428571428571,2233.3333333333335,2500.0,18333.333333333336,1274.4444444444446,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,690.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25.45,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,397.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,1292.0,221.0,,0.0,,,,,286.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,55.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,3647.0,,284.0,,139474.636,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,1033.0,784.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,1733.0,,,,,194.0,,,24214.003,544.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,250.0,4.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.004999999999999999,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0825,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,1814.4,,0.0,1472.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.512,,,,,,7690.611,,695.9620000000001,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,1387.0,,,,234.0,329.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.06420000000000001,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,4.1117163,14.428061,14

158,184,Linden,Tilia,"<i>Tilia</i> is a genus of about 30 species of trees native throughout most of the temperate Northern Hemisphere. Commonly called lime trees in the British Isles, they are not related to the lime fruit. Other names include linden, and basswood for the North American species. The genus occurs in Europe and eastern North America, but the greatest species diversity is found in Asia. Under the Cronquist classification system, this genus was placed in the family Tiliaceae, but genetic research summarised by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has resulted in the incorporation of this genus, and of most of the previous family, into the Malvaceae.<i>Tilia</i> species are mostly large, deciduous trees, reaching typically 20 to 40 metres (65 to 130 ft) tall, with oblique-cordate leaves 6 to 20 centimetres (2 1ä‹4 to 7 3ä‹4 in) across. As with elms, the exact number of species is uncertain, as many if not most of the species will hybridise readily, both in the wild and in cultivation. Limes are hermaphroditic, having perfect flowers with both male and female parts, pollinated by insects.The dried flowers are mildly sweet and sticky, and the fruit is somewhat sweet and mucilaginous. Limeflower tea has a pleasing taste, due to the aromatic volatile oil found in the flowers. The flowers, leaves, wood, and charcoal (obtained from the wood) are used for medicinal purposes. Active ingredients in the <i>Tilia</i> flowers include flavonoids (which act as antioxidants) and volatile oils. The plant also contains tannins that can act as an astringent.Linden flowers are used in herbalism for colds, cough, fever, infections, inflammation, high blood pressure, headache (particularly migraine), and as a diuretic (increases urine production), antispasmodic (reduces smooth muscle spasm along the digestive tract), and sedative. In the traditional Austrian medicine <i>Tilia</i> sp. flowers have been used internally as tea for treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, fever and flu. New evidence shows that the flowers may be hepatoprotective. The wood is used for liver and gallbladder disorders and cellulitis (inflammation of the skin and surrounding soft tissue). That wood burned to charcoal is ingested to treat intestinal disorders and used topically to treat edema or infection such as cellulitis or ulcers of the lower leg.Usually, the double-flowered species are used to make perfumes. The leaf buds and young leaves are also edible raw. Tilia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera; see List of Lepidoptera that feed on <i>Tilia</i>.

159,186,Fenugreek,Trigonella foenum-graecum,"Fenugreek  (Trigonella foenum-graecum) is an annual plant in the family Fabaceae, with leaves consisting of three small obovate to oblong leaflets. It is cultivated worldwide as a semiarid crop. Its seeds and its leaves are common ingredients in dishes from South Asia. Fenugreek is used as a herb (dried or fresh leaves), spice (seeds), and vegetable (fresh leaves, sprouts, and microgreens). Sotolon is the chemical responsible for fenugreek's distinctive sweet smell. Cuboid-shaped, yellow- to amber-coloured fenugreek seeds are frequently encountered in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, used both whole and powdered in the preparation of pickles, vegetable dishes dal, and spice mixes such as panch phoron and sambar powder. They are often roasted to reduce bitterness and enhance flavour. Constituents of fenugreek seeds include flavonoids, alkaloids, coumarins, vitamins, and saponins; the most prevalent alkaloid is trigonelline and coumarins include cinnamic acid and scopoletin (Wikipedia).",505590.0,Fenugreek,186.jpg,image/jpeg,149323.0,2012-04-20 09:44:26 UTC,197.0,Herbs and Spices,Herbs,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:25 UTC,2017-06-22 23:28:01 UTC,,,False,specific,78534.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,837.5,23000.0,24600.0,58725.0,6574.25,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,11311.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,29796.0137,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,532.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.825,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,15764.0,19.034,,0.0,,,,,,,3263.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,9000.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.44599999999999995,,0.115,,40663.37,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8872.840999999999,1118.03,0.0,,57.0,,,,,0.0,,13.068,,,,,403.0,,,3010.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3872.0,710.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,1.093,99.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,3103.0,1755.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,277.0,0.0,131.0,,0.0,9225.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.964,,,,,,2.02,,155.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,1163.0,1331.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-13.19526,-29.494547,14

171,202,Cowpea,Vigna unguiculata,"The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is one of several species of the widely cultivated genus Vigna. Four subspecies are recognised, of which three are cultivated: Vigna unguiculata subsp. dekindtiana, the wild relative of the cultivated subspecies Vigna unguiculata subsp. cylindrica, cultivated, catjang Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis, cultivated, yardlong beans Vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata, cultivated, black-eyed pea Cowpeas are one of the most important food legume crops in the semiarid tropics covering Asia, Africa, southern Europe and Central and South America. A drought-tolerant and warm-weather crop, cowpeas are well-adapted to the drier regions of the tropics, where other food legumes do not perform well. It also has the useful ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules, and it grows well in poor soils with more than 85% sand and with less than 0.2% organic matter and low levels of phosphorus. In addition, it is shade tolerant, so is compatible as an intercrop with maize, millet, sorghum, sugarcane, and cotton. This makes cowpeas an important component of traditional intercropping systems, especially in the complex and elegant subsistence farming systems of the dry savannas in sub-Saharan Africa. In these systems the haulm (dried stalks) of cowpea is a valuable by-product, used as animal feed. Research in Ghana found that selecting early generations of cowpea crops to increase yield is not an effective strategy. Francis Padi from the Savannah Agricultural Research Institute in Tamale, Ghana, writing in Crop Science, suggests other methods such as bulk breeding are more efficient in developing high-yield varieties. Cowpeas are a common food item in the Southern United States, where they are often called black-eyed peas or field peas. Two subcategories of field peas are crowder peas, so called because they are crowded together in their pods, causing them to have squarish ends, and cream peas. In India, in Oriya, it is called jhudunga, in Bengali, it is called barboti kolai, in Kannada, it is called Alasande, in Telugu, it is called Alasandalu, Bobbarlu. In Hindi, it is called lobhia or bura (when used as a string bean). In Gujarati, these are called chola or chowla. In Marathi, these are called chawali or chavali. According to the USDA food database, the leaves of the cowpea plant have the highest percentage of calories from protein among vegetarian foods.",27018.0,Cowpea,202.jpg,image/jpeg,74230.0,2012-04-20 09:41:44 UTC,214.0,Pulses,Peas,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:26 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:26 UTC,,,False,specific,3917.0,True,,,,,,0.6666666666666666,,,,11.833333333333334,,,,,54.0,39.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,7.333333333333333,,0.0,,,,79.83333333333333,3656.6666666666665,3300.0,5653.333333333333,225.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,254.003,0.0,0.0,0.0,46.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,260.08,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.6,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2773.581,43.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,67705.27225,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.017,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,183.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,880.0,,0.3,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.933,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.007,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,1279.0,,0.0,1531.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,1304.0,,15482.084,,,,,250.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,1220.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-4.7688327,9.4138565,17
172,203,Muscadine grape,Vitis rotundifolia,"Muscadine (Vitis rotundifolia) is a grapevine species native to the present-day southeastern United States that has been extensively cultivated since the 16th century. Its natural range is recognized in the following states of the US: Alabama, Arkansas, the Carolinas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. The plants are well adapted to their native warm and humid climate; they need fewer chilling hours than better known varieties and they thrive on summer heat. Muscadine berries range from bronze to dark purple to black in color when ripe. However, many wild varieties stay green through maturity. They have skin sufficiently tough that eating the raw fruit often involves biting a small hole in the skin to suck out the pulp inside. Muscadines are not only eaten fresh, but also are used in making wine, juice, and jelly. Muscadine grapes are rich sources of polyphenols and other nutrients studied for their potential health benefits. Gallic acid, (+)-catechin and epicatechin are the major phenolics in seeds, while ellagic acid, myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and trans-resveratrol are the major phenolics in the skins. In a natural setting, muscadines are important plants for improving wildlife habitat by providing cover, browse, and fruit for a wide variety of animals.",28609.0,Muscadine,203.jpg,image/jpeg,78997.0,2012-04-20 09:36:58 UTC,215.0,Fruits,Berries,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:26 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:26 UTC,,,False,specific,103349.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,147.5,810.0,3900.0,13930.0,470.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9000.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,152.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,15.294429999999998,,,,,1861.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,360.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.037,0.0065,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,7.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,19.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-21.486238,-10.879326,12
173,204,Common grape,Vitis vinifera,"Vitis vinifera (Common Grape Vine) is a species of Vitis, native to the Mediterranean region, central Europe, and southwestern Asia, from Morocco and Portugal north to southern Germany and east to northern Iran. It is a liana growing to 35 yards tall, with flaky bark. The leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, 5äóñ20Œæcm long and broad. The fruit is a berry, known as a grape; in the wild species it is 6Œæmm diameter and ripens dark purple to blackish with a pale wax bloom; in cultivated plants it is usually much larger, up to 3Œæcm long, and can be green, red, or purple (black). The species typically occurs in humid forests and streamsides. The wild grape is often classified as V. vinifera subsp. sylvestris (in some classifications considered Vitis sylvestris), with V. vinifera subsp. vinifera restricted to cultivated forms. Domesticated vines have hermaphrodite flowers, but subsp. sylvestris is dioecious and pollination is required for fruit to develop. The grape is eaten fresh, processed to make wine, or dried to produce raisins. Cultivars of Vitis vinifera form the basis of the majority of wines produced around the world. All of the familiar wine varieties belong to Vitis vinifera, which is cultivated on every continent except for Antarctica, and in all the major wine regions of the world.",28629.0,Vitis vinifera,204.jpg,image/jpeg,61176.0,2012-04-20 09:29:18 UTC,216.0,Fruits,Berries,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:26 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:26 UTC,,,False,specific,29760.0,True,,1.5,0.0,,,12.666666666666666,0.0,,,24.0,,,,,103.16666666666667,157.16666666666666,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,5.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,579.8333333333334,3230.0,5533.333333333333,56183.20833333333,4070.5166666666664,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,2032.5010000000002,0.0,0.0,0.0,74860.17309,,0.0,0.0,,118.0,,,0.0,221.0,0.0,,24267.606999999996,,,,,,18690.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,54.0,0.0,,91095.25251,1136.0,,0.0,,,,,,,3969.5594,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,37.0009,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,151671.75259999998,0.0,0.0,,70.0,0.0,0.0,15053.164999999999,6869.541,43983.1106,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,4540.03879,,,,,2424.0,,,760.1936000000001,0.0,64703.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,443.033,1510.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,16829.805,19.004,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5320.0,0.0,211.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,103.0,,,59800.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2125.0860000000002,374.082,21643.5554,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,7942.210099999999,,0.0,1533.2810000000002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,69600.0,,,,,,17508.6997,,1745.4509999999998,,,,,730.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,12139.0,540.0,,,39.01,0.0,,,,6882.0,,,0.0,,,78.476,,,,,,,340.0,0.0,116.50800000000001,,0.0,0.0,7.841528,10.783155,12

It is on occasion referred to as a ""shaved peach"", ""fuzzy-less peach"", ""juicy peach"", or ""Brazilian peach"" due to its lack of fuzz or short hairs. Though fuzzy peaches and nectarines are regarded commercially as different fruits, with nectarines often erroneously believed to be a crossbreed between peaches and plums, or a ""peach with a plum skin"", nectarines belong to the same species as peaches. Several genetic studies have concluded nectarines are produced due to a recessive allele, whereas a fuzzy peach skin is dominant. Nectarines have arisen many times from peach trees, often as bud sports.As with peaches, nectarines can be white or yellow, and clingstone or freestone. On average, nectarines are slightly smaller and sweeter than peaches, but with much overlap. The lack of skin fuzz can make nectarine skins appear more reddish than those of peaches, contributing to the fruit's plum-like appearance. The lack of down on nectarines' skin also means their skin is more easily bruised than peaches.",530965.0,Nectarine#Nectarines,229.jpg,image/jpeg,36256.0,2012-04-20 09:43:12 UTC,244.0,Fruits,Drupes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:27 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:26 UTC,,,False,specific,323851.0,True,,,,,,2.0,,,,86.0,,,,,111.0,2.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,141.33333333333334,1060.0,1700.0,10016.666666666666,310.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,3872.012,0.0,0.0,0.0,126600.46,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,777.0,12.0,,0.0,,,,,,,330.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,90357.857,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,34078.179,0.0,3846.001,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,17639.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1856.0,0.069,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,4402.0,0.018,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,3482.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,11423.00049,,0.0,0.0003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,18733.000000000004,,12118.001,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,2710.0,,0.0,0.0,14.190376,4.9782147,12

The earliest record of rambutan trees show that they were cultivated by the Malayan jungle tribes around their temporary settlements, a practice followed to date. Rambutan trees grow naturally in Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, although its precise natural distribution is unknown. It is closely related to several other edible tropical fruits including the lychee, longan, and mamoncillo. It is native to the Indonesian Archipelago, from where it spread westwards to Thailand, Burma, Sri Lanka and India; northwards to Vietnam, and the Philippines.The fruit is a round to oval single seeded berry, 3?6 cm (rarely to 8 cm) tall and 3?4 cm broad, borne in a loose pendant cluster of 10?20 together. The leathery skin is reddish (rarely orange or yellow), and covered with fleshy pliable spines, hence the name rambutan, derived from the Malay word rambut, which means hairs.

182,241,Welsh onion,Allium fistulosum,"Allium fistulosum L. (Welsh onion, Japanese bunching onion) is a perennial onion. Other names that may be applied to this plant include green onion, spring onion, scallion, escallion, and salad onion. These names are ambiguous, as they may also be used to refer to any young green onion stalk, whether grown from Welsh onions, common onions, or other similar members of the genus Allium (see scallion). The species is very similar in taste and odor to the related common onion, Allium cepa, and hybrids between the two (tree onions) exist.

183,242,Hard wheat,Triticum durum,"Durum wheat or macaroni wheat (Triticum durum or Triticum turgidum subsp. durum) is the only tetraploid species of wheat of commercial importance that is widely cultivated today. It was developed by artificial selection of the domesticated emmer wheat (like emmer, durum wheat is awned) strains formerly grown in Central Europe and the Near East around 7000 BC, which developed a naked, free-threshing form. Durum in Latin means ""hard"", and the species is the hardest of all wheats. Its high protein content, as well as its strength, make durum good for special uses, the most well-known being pasta, which in Italy is exclusively made from durum wheat. Durum wheat is used extensively in breadmaking. However, it is unusual in that, despite very high protein content, it is low in desirable gluten needed to form a glutinous web necessary for bread to rise. As a result, although 100 percent durum wheat breads do exist, such as pagnotte di Enna or ""rimacinato"" bread from Sicily, as well as others, in most instances bread doughs contain only a portion of durum wheat and are supplemented substantially with commercial white flours, often those higher in gluten necessary to offset the poor gluten contribution of durum flour. When durum flour is used as the sole flour in bread, substantial additions of isolated wheat gluten are necessary to effect rising. Without it, 100 percent durum wheat breads are often heavy, with very close grain, and will split easily when risen for baking.",42240.0,Hard_wheat,242.jpg,image/jpeg,49577.0,2012-04-20 09:40:44 UTC,257.0,Cereals and cereal products,Cereals,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:28 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:26 UTC,,,False,specific,4567.0,True,,,,,,9.0,,,,335.0,,,,,930.0,48.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,878.5,13680.0,,71130.0,2470.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5991.3631000000005,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,2311.62,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,1531.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.217,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,392.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,3399.035,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,123.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-19.090542,-25.763542,5

186,246,Triticale,X Triticosecale rimpaui,"Triticale (í„ Triticosecale), is a hybrid of wheat (Triticum) and rye (Secale) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century. The grain was originally bred in Scotland and Sweden. Commercially available triticale is almost always a second generation hybrid, i.e. , a cross between two kinds of primary (first cross) triticales. As a rule, triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance (including soil conditions) of rye. Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop. Depending on the cultivar, triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents. It is grown mostly for forage or fodder, although some triticale-based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals. When crossing wheat and rye, wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent (pollen donor). The resulting hybrid is sterile, and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself. The primary producers of triticale are Poland, Germany, France, Belarus and Australia. In 2009, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the world. The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid, which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species. In other words, triticale is an allotetraploid. In earlier years, most work was done on octoploid triticale. Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time. The tetraploids showed little promise, but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application. The CIMMYT triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries. Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products, such as cookies, pasta, pizza dough and breakfast cereals. The protein content is higher than that of wheat, although the glutenin fraction is less. The grain has also been stated to have higher levels of lysine than wheat. Assuming increased acceptance, the milling industry will have to adapt to triticale, as the milling techniques employed for wheat are unsuited to triticale. Sell et al. found triticale could be used as a feed grain, and later research found its starch was particularly readily digested. As a feed grain, triticale is already well established and of high economic importance. It has received attention as a potential energy crop, and research is currently being conducted on the use of the crop's biomass in bioethanol production.",506625.0,Triticale,246.jpg,image/jpeg,153276.0,2012-04-20 09:43:10 UTC,261.0,Cereals and cereal products,Cereals,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:28 UTC,2015-10-02 21:24:42 UTC,,,False,specific,,True,,,,,,17.0,,,,166.0,,,,,797.0,57.0,,,14.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,873.5,13115.0,14600.0,72635.0,1950.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,357.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5707.1006,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,927.28,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,7559.32146,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.018,0.033,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,9491.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,4330.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,76.0,,0.0,22.069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,71104.0,,26150.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-8.287098,-27.316513,5

Nappa cabbage is lighter in color than other Chinese cabbages such as bok choy, which is also sometimes called Chinese cabbage. In the United Kingdom, this vegetable is known as ""Chinese Leaf"", in New Zealand, as ""Wong Bok"" or ""Won bok"", and in Australia and the Philippines as ""wombok"".In Korean cuisine, it is the main ingredient of baechu kimchi, the most common type of kimchi, but is also eaten raw as a wrap for pork or oysters, dipped in gochujang. The outer, tougher leaves are used in soups. The flavor has been described by some as delicate compared to bok choy or cabbage, and it can be used in stir-fry with other ingredients such as tofu, mushroom or zucchini.

Bread is usually made from a wheat-flour dough that is cultured with yeast, allowed to rise, and finally baked in an oven. Owing to its high levels of gluten (which give the dough sponginess and elasticity), common wheat (also known as bread wheat) is the most common grain used for the preparation of bread, but bread is also made from the flour of other wheat species (including durum, spelt and emmer), rye, barley, maize (corn), and oats, usually, but not always, in combination with wheat flour.

199,274,Pasta,,"Pasta is a type of noodle and is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine, with the first reference dating to 1154 in Sicily. It is also commonly used to refer to the variety of pasta dishes. Typically pasta is made from an unleavened dough of a durum wheat flour mixed with water and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked and served in any number of dishes. It can be made with flour from other cereals or grains, and eggs may be used instead of water. Pastas may be divided into two broad categories, dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca). Chicken eggs frequently dominate as the source of the liquid component in fresh pasta. Most dried pasta is commercially produced via an extrusion process. Fresh pasta was traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines, but today many varieties of fresh pasta are also commercially produced by large scale machines, and the products are broadly available in supermarkets. Both dried and fresh pasta come in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310 specific forms known variably by over 1300 names having been recently documented. In Italy the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary with locale. For example the form cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending on region and town. Common forms of pasta include long shapes, short shapes, tubes, flat shapes and sheets, miniature soup shapes, filled or stuffed, and specialty or decorative shapes. As a category in Italian cuisine, both dried and fresh pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes. As pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta) cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary sauce or condiment. A second classification of pasta dishes is pasta in brodo in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is pasta al forno in which the pasta incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked. Pasta is generally a simple dish, but comes in large varieties because it is a versatile food item. Some pasta dishes are served as a first course in Italy because the portion sizes are small and simple. The servings are usually accompanied by a side of meat. Pasta is also prepared in light lunches, such as salads or large portion sizes for dinner. It can be prepared by hand or food processor and served hot or cold. Pasta sauces vary in taste, color and texture. When choosing which type of pasta and sauce to serve together, there is a general rule that must be observed. Simple sauces like pesto are ideal for long and thin strands of pasta while tomato sauce combines well with thicker pastas. Thicker and chunkier sauces have the better ability to cling onto the holes and cuts of short, tubular, twisted pastas. Sauce should be served equally with its pasta. It is important that the sauce does not overflow the pasta. The extra sauce is left on the plate after all of the pasta is eaten.",,Pasta,274.jpg,image/jpeg,2205799.0,2012-04-20 09:34:38 UTC,297.0,Cereals and cereal products,Cereal products,Type 2,2011-02-09 00:37:29 UTC,2017-03-29 20:25:03 UTC,,2.0,False,specific,,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,0.0,15.673469387755102,1.2307692307692308,795.1818181818181,2.272727272727273,535.3846153846154,22.0,,110.0,,985.5384615384615,110.11538461538461,,0.0,9.333333333333334,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.23076923076923078,3.3125,,7.6923076923076925,0.0,1.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.13793103448275862,0.9090909090909091,0.0,0.0,666.3831775700935,8776.923076923076,4058.974358974359,54097.09401709401,2090.4807692307695,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,31900.6692,0.0,0.0,0.0,1927684.9016599995,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,124779.98499999999,63895.2437,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1273331.3874100002,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,512499.0402999999,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,152696.096,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,13587.096,0.002,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,1441.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,5712.3721,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,123861.56249999999,,0.0,68067.64861999999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,249493.66364999997,,475674.61566000007,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,167670.642,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,35.859924,30.456388,5

203,280,Abalone,Haliotis,"Abalone, is a common name for any of a group of small to very large edible sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Haliotidae. Other common names are ear shells, sea ears, as well as muttonfish or muttonshells in Australia, ormer in Great Britain, perlemoen and venus's-ears in South Africa in New Zealand. The family Haliotidae contains only one genus, Haliotis. That genus contains about four to seven subgenera. The number of species recognized worldwide ranges between 30 and 130 with over 230 species-level taxa described. The most comprehensive treatment of the family considers 56 species valid, with 18 additional subspecies. The shells of abalones have a low and open spiral structure, and are characterized by several open respiratory pores in a row near the shell's outer edge. The thick inner layer of the shell is composed of nacre or mother-of-pearl, which in many species is highly iridescent, giving rise to a range of strong and changeable colors, which make the shells attractive to humans as decorative objects, jewelry, and as a source of colorful mother-of-pearl. The flesh of abalones is widely considered to be a desirable food, and is consumed raw or cooked in a variety of different dishes.",69493.0,Abalone,280.jpg,image/jpeg,99231.0,2012-04-20 09:41:13 UTC,307.0,Aquatic foods,Mollusks,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:30 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:27 UTC,,,False,specific,6452.0,True,,,,,,21.0,,,,1404.0,,,,,740.5,47.5,,6.5,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,43.5,,,,381.0,18365.0,0.0,8530.0,3770.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,470.1559,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,22.0,5.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,78669.204,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,5800.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1.028,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0001,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,4560.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,5.7,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,13.0,,1.306,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-3.6792784,11.12364,1

Agar is a mixture of two components: the linear polysaccharide agarose, and a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules called agaropectin. Throughout history into modern times, agar has been chiefly used as an ingredient in desserts throughout Asia and also as a solid substrate to contain culture medium for microbiological work. Agar (agar-agar) can be used as a laxative, an appetite suppressant, vegetarian gelatin substitute, a thickener for soups, in fruit preserves, ice cream, and other desserts, as a clarifying agent in brewing, and for sizing paper and fabrics. The gelling agent is an unbranched polysaccharide obtained from the cell walls of some species of red algae, primarily from the genera Gelidium and Gracilaria. For commercial purposes, it is derived primarily from Gelidium amansii.

215,292,Asian pear,Pyrus pyrifolia,"Pyrus pyrifolia is a pear tree species native to China, Japan, and Korea. The tree's edible fruit is known by many names, including: Asian pear, Chinese pear, Korean pear, Japanese pear, Taiwan pear, and sand pear. Along with cultivars of P. í„ bretschneideri and P. ussuriensis, the fruit is also called the nashi pear. Despite being colloquially known as an apple pear due to its appearance and texture, the fruit is not a hybrid of the two. Cultivars derived from Pyrus pyrifolia are grown throughout East Asia, and in other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (e.g. , California). Traditionally in East Asia the tree's flowers are a popular symbol of early spring, and it is a common sight in gardens and the countryside. The fruits are generally not baked in pies or made into jams because they have a high water content and a crisp, grainy texture, very different from the buttery European varieties. They are commonly served raw and peeled. The fruit tends to be quite large and fragrant, and when carefully wrapped (it has a tendency to bruise because of its juiciness), it can last for several weeks or more in a cold, dry place.",25296.0,Pyrus pyrifolia,292.jpg,image/jpeg,46639.0,2012-04-20 09:36:50 UTC,319.0,Fruits,Pomes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:30 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:27 UTC,,,False,specific,3767.0,True,,,,,,1.0,,,,47.0,,,,,54.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,109.0,500.0,3600.0,10650.0,230.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.48,0.0,0.0,0.0,3958.06941,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,496.0,207.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1186.0001,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,6250.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0001,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,8e-05,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.07,,0.0,0.0028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,1582.009,,86900.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-37.578743,-15.5265465,12
216,293,Atlantic herring,Clupea harengus harengus,"Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) is a herring in the family Clupeidae. It is one of the most abundant fish species on earth. Atlantic herrings can be found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, congregating in large schools. They can grow up to 45 centimetres in length and weigh more than 0.5 kilograms . They feed on copepods, krill and small fish, while their natural predators are seals, whales, cod and other larger fish. The Atlantic herring fishery has long been an important part of the economy of New England and the Canadian Maritime provinces. This is because the fish congregate relatively near to the coast in massive schools, notably in the cold waters of the semi-enclosed Gulf of Maine and Gulf of St. Lawrence. North Atlantic herring schools have been measured up to 4 cubic kilometres in size, containing an estimated 4 billion fish.",161724.0,Atlantic herring,293.jpg,image/jpeg,10362.0,2012-04-20 09:34:09 UTC,320.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:30 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:27 UTC,,,False,specific,7950.0,True,,,,,,774.6,,,,1885.8,,,,,845.8,174.8,,181.2,1340.4,,,,,43.8,,,,,1862.6,,56.0,,,,543.2,20876.0,0.0,1928.0,12490.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,15230.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,177795.10499999998,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.014,2.57,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,173732.6746,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,25.7,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,47.3,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,13321.008,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,17.1,,0.0,21.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,235.6095,,1357.875,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,2.948,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,19.087742,12.012254,1
217,294,Atlantic mackerel,Scomber scombrus,"The Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), is a pelagic schooling species of mackerel found on both sides of the North Atlantic Ocean. The species is also called Boston mackerel, or just mackerel. The Atlantic Mackerel is by far the most common of the ten species of the family that are caught in British waters. It is extremely common in huge shoals migrating towards the coast to feed on small fish and prawns during the summer. Abundant in cold and temperate shelf areas, it forms large schools near the surface. They overwinter in deeper waters but move closer to shore in spring when water temperatures range between 11äóñ14ŒæŒÁC (52äóñ57ŒæŒÁF). In north-east Atlantic: North Sea (east) and British Isles (west). The North Sea stock decreased dramatically in the 1960s because of direct overfishing. Male and female Atlantic mackerel grow at about the same rate, reaching a maximum age of about 20 years and a maximum fork length of about 47 centimetres . Most Atlantic mackerel are sexually mature by the age of three years.",172414.0,Atlantic mackerel,294.jpg,image/jpeg,60948.0,2012-04-20 09:36:52 UTC,321.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:30 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:27 UTC,,,False,specific,13677.0,True,,,,,,630.5,,,,1742.5,,,,,183.0,136.0,,278.0,1318.5,,,,,117.0,,,,,1952.5,,159.0,,,,605.25,21225.0,0.0,0.0,15850.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13.0,,,,11970.473399999999,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,309.0,27.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,81256.43600000002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90232.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.063,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,681.0,,,4400.0,,,,,,,,,,,16.119,,36.49699999999999,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.197,,,,,,,,,,,,,-8.748747,12.194889,1

They are commonly sighted throughout Asia. The numbers of the Atlantic wolffish are rapidly being depleted apparently due to overfishing and bycatch, and is currently a Species of Concern according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service. Although it looks fearsome, the Atlantic wolffish is only a threat to humans when defending itself out of the water. Apart from their unique appearance wolffish are distinguished by the natural antifreeze they produce to keep their blood moving fluidly in their very cold habitat, involvement by both the male and female in brood bearing, and the large size of their eggs. They are also an important factor in controlling green crab and sea urchin populations, which can become overly disruptive to habitats if left unchecked.

The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6äóñ12 million.

224,301,Beech nut,Fagus,"Beech (Fagus) is a genus of deciduous trees in the family Fagaceae, native to temperate Europe, Asia and North America. Recent classification systems of the genus recognize ten to thirteen species in two distinct subgenera, Engleriana and Fagus. The Engleriana subgenus is found only in East Asia, and is notably distinct from the Fagus subgenus in that these beeches are low-branching trees, often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark. Further differentiating characteristics include the whitish bloom on the underside of the leaves, the visible tertiary leaf veins, and a long, smooth cupule-peduncle. Fagus japonica, Fagus engleriana, and the species F. okamotoi, proposed by the bontanist Chung-Fu Shen in 1992, comprise this subgenus. The more well-known Fagus subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark. This group includes Fagus sylvatica, Fagus grandifolia, Fagus crenata, Fagus lucida, Fagus longipetiolata, and Fagus hayatae.The European beech (Fagus sylvatica) is the most commonly cultivated, although there are few important differences between species aside from detail elements such as leaf shape. The leaves of beech trees are entire or sparsely toothed, from 5?15 cm long and 4?10 cm broad. Beeches are monoecious, bearing both male and female flowers on the same plant. The small flowers are unisexual, the female flowers borne in pairs, the male flowers wind-pollinating catkins. They are produced in spring shortly after the new leaves appear. The bark is smooth and light grey. The fruit is a small, sharply three?angled nut 10?15 mm long, borne singly or in pairs in soft-spined husks 1.5?2.5 cm long, known as cupules. The husk can have a variety of spine- to scale-like appendages, the character of which is, in addition to leaf shape, one of the primary ways beeches are differentiated. The nuts are edible, though bitter (though not nearly as bitter as acorns) with a high tannin content, and are called beechnuts or beechmast.",19461.0,Beech,301.jpg,image/jpeg,29680.0,2012-04-20 09:43:07 UTC,328.0,Nuts,Nuts,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:31 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:27 UTC,,,False,specific,21024.0,True,,,,,,287.0,,,,18849.0,,,,,18390.0,1700.0,,,2757.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1493.0,6200.0,,33500.0,50000.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7129.1,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,12100.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,131.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,325.0,44.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0069,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,6.0,,0.0,0.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,4.231,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-9.384034,-13.071629,16

229,308,Northern bluefin tuna,Thunnus thynnus,"The Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) is a species of tuna in the Scombridae family. It is variously known as the northern bluefin tuna (mainly when including Pacific bluefin as a subspecies), giant bluefin tuna (for individuals exceeding 150 kilograms or around 330Œæpounds) and formerly as the tunny. Atlantic bluefin are native to both the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. Atlantic bluefin have become extinct in the Black Sea. The Atlantic bluefin tuna is a close relative of the other two bluefin tuna speciesäóîthe Pacific bluefin tuna and the southern bluefin tuna. Atlantic bluefin tuna may exceed 450 kilograms in weight, and rival the black marlin, blue marlin and swordfish as the largest Perciformes. Throughout recorded history, the Atlantic bluefin tuna has been highly prized as a food fish. Besides their commercial value as food, the great size, speed, and power they display as apex predators has attracted the admiration of fishermen, writers, and scientists. The Atlantic bluefin tuna has been the foundation of one of the world's most lucrative commercial fisheries. Medium-sized and large individuals are heavily targeted for the Japanese raw fish market, where all bluefin species are highly prized for sushi and sashimi. This commercial importance has led to severe overfishing. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) affirmed in October 2009 that Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks have declined dramatically over the last 40 years, by 72% in the Eastern Atlantic, and by 82% in the Western Atlantic. On 16 October 2009, Monaco formally recommended Endangered Atlantic bluefin tuna for an Appendix I CITES listing and international trade ban. In early 2010, European officials, led by the French ecology minister, increased pressure to ban the commercial fishing of bluefin tuna internationally. European Union nations, who are responsible for most bluefin tuna overfishing, later abstained from voting to protect the species from international trade. Most Bluefin are captured commercially by professional fishermen using longlines; purse seines, assorted hook-and-line gear, heavy rod and reels, and harpoon. Recreationally, bluefin has been one of the most important big-game species sought by sports fishermen since the 1930s, particularly in the United States but also in Canada, Spain, France and Italy.",172421.0,Atlantic bluefin tuna,308.jpg,image/jpeg,40029.0,2012-04-20 09:29:06 UTC,335.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:31 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:27 UTC,,,False,specific,8237.0,True,,,,,,185.0,,,,1054.5,,,,,60.5,0.0,,44.5,316.0,,,,,49.0,,,,,270.5,,142.5,,,,425.0,26620.0,0.0,0.0,5590.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17.0,,,,124.94,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.01,0.12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,104.005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.38,,,20.0,,,,,,,,,,,2200.1013000000003,,13.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,340.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-30.964552,-1.8850979,1

Ancestors of the Polynesians found the trees growing in the northwest New Guinea area around 3,500 years ago. They gave up the rice cultivation they had brought with them from Taiwan, and raised breadfruit wherever they went in the Pacific (except Easter Island and New Zealand, which are too cold).

234,313,Breadnut tree seed,Brosimum alicastrum,"Brosimum alicastrum, the breadnut or Maya nut, is a Brosimum tree species under the Moraceae family of flowering plants, whose other genera include fig and mulberries The plant is known by a range of names in indigenous Mesoamerican and other languages, including but not limited to: ramon,ojoche, ojite, ojushte, ujushte, ujuxte, capomo, mojo, ox, iximche, masica in Honduras, uje in Michoacan, and mojote in Jalisco. Two subspecies are commonly recognized: Brosimum alicastrum ssp. alicastrum Brosimum alicastrum ssp. bolivarense Distribution and habitat: The west coast of central Mexico, southern Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, the Caribbean, and the Amazon. Large stands in moist lowland tropical forests 300äóñ2000 m elevation (especially 125äóñ800 m), in humid areas where rainfall of 600äóñ2000Œæmm, and average temperature 24 C / 75 F. The breadnut fruit disperses on the ground at different times throughout its range. It has a large seed covered by a thin, citrus-flavored orange-colored skin favored by a number of forest creatures. More important, the large seed which is enveloped by the tasty skin is an edible äóÖnutäó» that can be boiled or dried and ground into a meal for porridge or flatbread. Breadnut is nutritious and has value as a food source, and formed a part of the diet of the pre-Columbian Maya of the lowlands region in Mesoamerica, although to what extent has been a matter of some debate among Maya historians and archaeologists. It was planted by the Maya civilization two thousand years ago and it has been claimed in several articles by Dennis E. Puleston to have been a staple food in the Maya diet, although other research has downplayed its significance. In the modern era it has been marginalized as a source of nutrition and has often been characterized as a famine food. The breadnut is extremely high in fiber, calcium, potassium, folic acid, iron, zinc, protein and B vitamins. It has a low glycemic index (<50) and is very high in antioxidants. The fresh seeds can be cooked and eaten or can be set out to dry in the sun to roast and eaten later. Stewed the nut tastes like mashed potato, roasted it tastes like chocolate or coffee and can be prepared in numerous other dishes. In Petí©n, Guatemala, the breadnut is being cultivated for exportation and local consumption as powder, for hot beverages, and bread. The tree can reach up to 45 meters (130Œæfeet). The tree lends its name to the Maya archaeological sites of Iximchí© and Topoxte, both in Guatemala and also of Tamuin (reflecting the Maya origin of the Huastec peoples). It is one of the twenty dominant species of the Maya forest. Of the dominant species, it is the only one that is wind-pollinated.

236,315,Brown bear,Ursus arctos,"The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear distributed across much of northern Eurasia and North America. Adult bears generally weigh between 100 and 635 kg (and lb) and its largest subspecies, the Kodiak bear, rivals the polar bear as the largest member of the bear family and as the largest land-based predator. There are several recognized subspecies within the brown bear species. In North America, two types are generally recognized, the coastal brown bear and the inland grizzly bear, and the two types could broadly define all brown bear subspecies. An adult grizzly living inland in Yukon may weigh as little as 80Œækg, while an adult brown bear in nearby coastal Alaska living on a steady, nutritious diet of spawning salmon may weigh as much as 680Œækg . The exact number of overall brown subspecies remains in debate. While the brown bear's range has shrunk and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a least concern species by the IUCN with a total population of approximately 200,000.

The North American range of this Holarctic animal extends from Alaska, through the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, into the boreal forest and south through the Canadian Rockies and the Columbia and Selkirk Mountains. The caribou is a specialist that is well adapted to cooler climates with hollow-hair fur that covers almost all of its body including its nose, and provides insulation in winter and flotation for swimming. Two major subspecies in North America, the R. t. granti and the R. t. groenlandicus form large herds and undertake lengthy seasonal migrations from birthing grounds, to summer and winter feeding grounds in the tundra and taiga. The migrations of R. t. granti Porcupine herd are among the longest of any terrestrial mammal.[3] The George River caribou herd (GRCH) of the R. t. caribou subspecies in the Ungava area?once the largest Rangifer tarandus herd in the world?declined to 74?131 animals?a drop of up to 92%.[4] In 2011 the combined Beverly/Ahiak herd in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, had approximately 124?000 caribou? at least a 50% drop since 1994; the Western caribou herd had 325?000 animals and the Qamanirjuaq caribou herd which is relatively stable had declined from 496?000 in 1994 to 345?000 in 2008. The meta-population of the more sedentary subspecies R. t. caribou or Woodland caribou spans the boreal forest from the Northwest Territories to Labrador. They are shy animals whose main food source is arboreal lichens[8] of the mature forests and mainly live in marshes, bogs, lakes, and river regions. Since it takes hundreds of years for a biomass of tree lichen to be adequate to sustain boreal woodland caribou populations, deforestation is a major factor in the decline of their numbers. The historic range of the boreal woodland caribou covered over half of present-day Canada, stretching from Alaska to Newfoundland and Labrador and as far south as New England, Idaho, and Washington. The smallest subspecies in North America, the Peary Caribou is found in the High and Low Arctic, in the Northwest Territories?particularly, Banks Island and in Nunavut?particularly, Baffin Island.",180701.0,Caribou,324.jpg,image/jpeg,105354.0,2012-04-20 09:42:14 UTC,351.0,Animal foods,Venison,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:35 UTC,2017-06-08 01:36:16 UTC,,,False,specific,9870.0,False,,1.25,0.0,,,83.5,11.25,,,1091.1666666666667,,,,,281.0,66.33333333333333,,2.0,13.6,6.25,,,2.5,123.33333333333333,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,37.166666666666664,0.0,,,672.6,26148.0,0.0,680.0,16737.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27619.0,,,,24879.700490000003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4800.8240000000005,1040.599,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,305562.68830000004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2048.438,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1321.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1380.56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.8303700000000003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20911.000500000002,,,5179.0,,,,,,,,,,,88456.618,,101702.015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,454.903,,,,,,,,,,,,,12.799667,21.443066,0
246,325,Natal plum,Carissa macrocarpa,"Carissa macrocarpa (Natal Plum), is a shrub native to South Africa, where it is commonly called the Large Num-Num. In Zulu, as well as in the Bantu tribes of Uganda, it is called amatungulu. In Afrikaans the fruit is called Noem-Noem. C. macrocarpa deals well with salt-laden winds, making it a good choice for coastal areas. It is commonly found in the coastal bush of the Eastern Cape and Natal. It produces shiny, deep green leaves and snowy white flowers whose perfumed scent intensifies at night. Like other Carissa species, C. macrocarpa is a spiny, evergreen shrub containing latex. They bloom for months at a time. The ornamental plump, round, crimson fruit appears in summer and fall (autumn) at the same time as the blooms. In moderate, coastal areas the fruits appear through the year. The fruit can be eaten out of hand or made into pies, jams, jellies, and sauces. Some claim that other than the fruit, the plant is poisonous. However this claim is a myth, possibly based on similarities to other plants with milky sap. The California Poison Control System rates the plant as mildly toxic. It appears in the South African National tree list as number 640.3. A traditional food plant in Africa, this little-known fruit has potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare.",501290.0,Carissa macrocarpa,325.jpg,image/jpeg,138161.0,2012-04-20 09:39:20 UTC,352.0,Fruits,Tropical fruits,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:35 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:28 UTC,,,False,specific,403101.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,160.5,500.0,,13630.0,1300.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,399.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1518.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,457.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,322.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,287.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,1235.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-20.456146,-9.389028,12

Chayote is originally native to Mexico or Central America where it grows abundantly and has little commercial value, and it has been introduced as a crop all over Latin America, and worldwide. The main growing regions are Brazil, Costa Rica and Veracruz, Mexico. Costa Rican chayotes are predominantly exported to the European Union, whereas Veracruz is the main exporter of chayotes to the United States. The word chayote is a Spanish derivative of the Nahuatl word chayohtli. Chayote was one of the many foods introduced to Europe by early explorers, who brought back a wide assortment of botanical samples. The Age of Conquest also spread the plant south from Mexico, ultimately causing it to be integrated into the cuisine of many other Latin American nations. The chayote fruit is used in mostly cooked forms. When cooked, chayote is usually handled like summer squash, it is generally lightly cooked to retain the crisp flavor. Though rare and often regarded as especially unpalatable and tough in texture, raw chayote may be added to salads or salsas, most often marinated with lemon or lime juice. Whether raw or cooked, chayote is a good source of amino acids and vitamin C. Although most people are familiar only with the fruit as being edible, the root, stem, seeds and leaves are as well. The tubers of the plant are eaten like potatoes and other root vegetables, while the shoots and leaves are often consumed in salads and stir fries, especially in Asia. Like other members of the gourd family, such as cucumbers, melons, and squash, chayote has a sprawling habit, and it should only be planted if there is plenty of room in the garden. The roots are also highly susceptible to rot, especially in containers, and the plant in general is finicky to grow. However, in Australia and New Zealand, it is an easily grown yard or garden plant, set on a chicken wire support or strung against a fence.",22441.0,Chayote,330.jpg,image/jpeg,2713.0,2012-04-20 09:42:21 UTC,357.0,Gourds,Gourds,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:35 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:28 UTC,,,False,specific,184140.0,True,,,,,,0.0,,,,9.0,,,,,21.0,36.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,59.0,686.6666666666666,2066.666666666667,13317.875,3029.2222222222226,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,54357.0008,0.0,0.0,0.0,1187461.4827000003,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,64975.0,828.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.5,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1269668.4586,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,331620.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,90128.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,71190.0,420.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,40423.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,159600.0,,0.0,44867.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,56.0,,,,,,152037.026,,112753.64039999999,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,49100.0,,0.0,0.0,33.235355,29.93624,13

258,337,Chinese water chestnut,Eleocharis dulcis,"The Chinese water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis; synonyms E. equisetina, E. indica, E. plantaginea, E. plantaginoides, E. tuberosa, E. tumida), more often called simply the water chestnut, is a grass-like sedge grown for its edible corms. The water chestnut is actually not a nut at all, but an aquatic vegetable that grows in marshes, underwater in the mud. It has tube-shaped, leafless green stems that grow to about 1.5 metres. The water caltrop, which is also referred to by the same name, is unrelated and often confused with the water chestnut.The small, rounded corms have a crisp white flesh and can be eaten raw, slightly boiled, or grilled, and are often pickled or tinned. They are a popular ingredient in Chinese dishes. In China, they are most often eaten raw, sometimes sweetened. They can also be ground into a flour form used for making water chestnut cake, which is common as part of dim sum cuisine. They are unusual among vegetables for remaining crisp even after being cooked or canned, because their cell walls are cross-linked and strengthened by certain phenolic compounds, like oligomers of ferulic acid. This property is shared by other vegetables that remain crisp in this manner, including the tiger nut and lotus root.The corms are rich in carbohydrates (about 90 percent by dry weight), especially starch (about 60 percent by dry weight), and are also a good source of dietary fiber, riboflavin, vitamin B6, potassium, copper, and manganese.If eaten uncooked, the surface of the plants can transmit Fasciolopsiasis.",506699.0,Chinese_water_chestnut,337.jpg,image/jpeg,93907.0,2012-04-20 09:30:00 UTC,364.0,Vegetables,Other vegetables,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:35 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:28 UTC,,,False,specific,110284.0,True,,,,,,1.0,,,,1.0,,,,,25.5,8.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,190.75,1140.0,2750.0,34985.0,490.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,12636.057,0.0,0.0,0.0,3950.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,354.2,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,3393.84,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,479.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.7,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,257.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,322.313,,0.0,0.396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,427.009,,16.563,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.026,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-17.29556,-17.995165,22

261,341,Coconut,Cocos nucifera,"The coconut tree (Cocos nucifera), is a member of the family Arecaceae (palm family). It is the only accepted species in the genus Cocos. The term coconut can refer to the entire coconut palm, the seed, or the fruit, which, botanically, is a drupe, not a nut. The spelling cocoanut is an archaic form of the word. The term is derived from 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish coco, meaning ""head"" or ""skull"", from the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features.Found throughout the tropic and subtropic area, the coconut is known for its great versatility as seen in the many uses of its different parts. Coconuts are part of the daily diets of many people. Coconuts are different from any other fruits because they contain a large quantity of ""water"" and when immature they are known as tender-nuts or jelly-nuts and may be harvested for drinking. When mature, they still contain some water and can be used as seednuts or processed to give oil from the kernel, charcoal from the hard shell and coir from the fibrous husk. The endosperm is initially in its nuclear phase suspended within the coconut water. As development continues, cellular layers of endosperm deposit along the walls of the coconut, becoming the edible coconut ""flesh"". When dried, the coconut flesh is called copra. The oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking and frying; coconut oil is also widely used in soaps and cosmetics. The clear liquid coconut water within is drinkable. The husks and leaves can be used as material to make a variety of products for furnishing and decorating. It also has cultural and religious significance in many societies that use it.",42451.0,Coconut,341.jpg,image/jpeg,16406.0,2012-04-20 09:28:56 UTC,368.0,Fruits,Tropical fruits,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:36 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:28 UTC,,,False,specific,13894.0,True,,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,3244.75,66.75,2116.470588235294,0.0,0.0,,0.0,556.9411764705883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,1.3333333333333333,0.0,2.0,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1474.4736842105262,2447.6470588235293,5244.2307692307695,13246.029411764706,54334.705882352944,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,11563.661,0.0,0.0,0.0,587315.1889,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,8.063,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,123822.15319999999,3036.6085,,0.0,,,,,,,465.0041,,0.0,,,0.07,,0.0,,,1630.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,118.0,,0.0,,518328.61030999996,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,101575.004,,,,,300.0,,,146.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,23125.996000000003,0.097,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,8577.881,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,4012.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,3578.16,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,24761.339999999997,,0.0,24414.405000000002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,,,,,,90112.762,,99645.52900000001,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,167.0,1055.19,,,,,,,0.0,,,1027.144,,,,,,,140.0,0.0,414.0,,0.0,0.0,29.745405,23.361982,12

They are commonly found in sounds and estuaries from Massachusetts to the Gulf of Mexico. The names croaker and drum are descriptive of the noise the fish makes by vibrating strong muscles against its swim bladder, which acts as a resonating chamber, much like a drum. During spawning season (August to December), croakers turn a deep golden color, from this comes the name golden croaker. When full-grown (three to four years), croakers reach between 1-1/2 feet long and 4-5 pounds, but on average are 1/2-2 pounds.

Also characteristic is the nature of the dorsal, caudal, and anal fins, they are continuous at the base but separated by very deep notches so that they are obviously distinct. It is distributed on both sides of the North Atlantic, mostly in moderately deep water. On the North American coast, it is regularly found southward to Cape Cod and occasionally off New Jersey.

272,352,Cuttlefish,Sepiidae,"Cuttlefish are marine animals of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. 'Cuttle' is a reference to their unique internal shell, the cuttlebone; and despite their name, cuttlefish are true mollusks. Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (to in), with the largest species, Sepia apama, reaching 50Œæcm in mantle length and over 10.5Œækg in weight. Cuttlefish eat small mollusks, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopuses, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators include dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. Their life expectancy is about one to two years. Recent studies indicate cuttlefish are among the most intelligent invertebrates. Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates. The 'cuttle' in 'cuttlefish' comes from the Old English word cudele, meaning 'cuttlefish', which may be cognate with the Old Norse koddi ('cushion') and the Middle Low German kí_del ('pouch'). The Greco-Roman world valued the cephalopod as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed. The word for it in both Greek and Latin, sepia, is now used to refer to a brown pigment in English.",82360.0,Cuttlefish,352.jpg,image/jpeg,127345.0,2012-04-20 09:39:57 UTC,379.0,Aquatic foods,Mollusks,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:36 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:28 UTC,,,False,specific,6608.0,True,,,,,,18.0,,,,46.5,,,,,3.0,1.5,,3.0,54.0,,,,,19.5,,,,,1.5,,9.0,,,,307.25,24360.0,0.0,1230.0,1050.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,11842.284,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3410.323,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,998.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.6,,,9074.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,3558.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-31.23813,1.3088812,1

277,357,Freshwater drum,Aplodinotus grunniens,"The freshwater drum, Aplodinotus grunniens, is a fish endemic to North and Central America. It is the only species in the genus Aplodinotus. The freshwater drum is a member of the family Sciaenidae, and is the only North American member of the group that inhabits freshwater for its entire life. Its generic name, Aplodinotus, comes from Greek meaning ""single back"", and the specific epithet, grunniens, comes from a Latin word meaning ""grunting"". It is given to it because of the grunting noise that mature males make. This noise comes from a special set of muscles within the body cavity that vibrate against the swim bladder. The purpose of the grunting is unknown, but due to it being present in only mature males, it is assumed to be linked to spawning.The drum typically weigh 5?15 lb (2.3?6.8 kg). The world record was caught on Nickajack Lake in Tennessee, and weighed in at 54 lb 8 oz (24.7 kg). The freshwater drum is gray or silvery in turbid waters and more bronze or brown colored in clearer waters. It is a deep bodied fish with a divided dorsal fin consisting of 10 spines and 29?32 rays. It is also called shepherd's pie, ""perch"", silver bass, gray bass, Gasper goo, Gaspergou, gou, grunt, grunter, grinder, wuss fish, and croaker, and is commonly known as sheephead or sheepshead in parts of Canada,[5] the United Kingdom, and the United States.",169364.0,Freshwater_drum,357.jpg,image/jpeg,80971.0,2012-04-20 09:34:53 UTC,384.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:37 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:28 UTC,,,False,specific,225389.0,True,,,,,,902.5,,,,1368.0,,,,,177.0,130.0,,,92.5,,,,,255.5,,,,,136.0,,164.5,,,,352.5,20015.0,0.0,0.0,5625.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26.0,,,,111434.3063,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14200.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,126.35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,490.0,,,6280.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,179.0003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21.35992,-8.041423,1

280,360,Durian,Durio zibethinus,"The durian is the fruit of several tree species belonging to the genus Durio and the family Malvacea (although some taxonomists place Durio in a distinct family, Durionaceae).Regarded by many people in southeast Asia as the ""king of fruits"", the durian is distinctive for its large size, strong odour, and formidable thorn-covered husk. The fruit can grow as large as 30 centimetres (12 in) long and 15 centimetres (6 in) in diameter, and it typically weighs one to three kilograms (2 to 7 lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale yellow to red, depending on the species.The edible flesh emits a distinctive odour that is strong and penetrating even when the husk is intact. Some people regard the durian as having a pleasantly sweet fragrance; others find the aroma overpowering and revolting. The smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust, and has been described variously as rotten onions, turpentine, and raw sewage. The persistence of its odour has led to the fruit's banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in Southeast Asia.",506099.0,Durian,360.jpg,image/jpeg,2958035.0,2012-04-20 09:38:23 UTC,387.0,Fruits,Tropical fruits,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:37 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:28 UTC,,,False,specific,66656.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,381.0,1470.0,3800.0,39087.125,4710.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,42220.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,797.8,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,300.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,4.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,224.0,,0.0,0.009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,0.08390000000000002,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-15.928028,-17.602552,12

282,362,Freshwater eel,Anguilla,"The Anguillidae are a family of fishes that contains the freshwater eels. The 19 species and six subspecies in this family are all in genus Anguilla. They are catadromous, meaning they spend their lives in freshwater rivers, lakes, or estuaries, and return to the ocean to spawn. The young eel larvae, called leptocephali, live only in the ocean and consume small particles called marine snow. They grow larger in size, and in their next growth stage they are called glass eels. At this stage they enter estuaries, and when they become pigmented they are known as elvers. Elvers travel upstream in freshwater rivers, where they grow to adulthood. Some details of eel reproduction are as yet unknown, and the discovery of the spawning area of the American and European eels in the Sargasso Sea is one of the more famous anecdotes in the history of Ichthyology (see Eel life history). The spawning areas of some other anguillid eels, such as the Japanese eel, and the giant mottled eel were also discovered recently in the western North Pacific Ocean.",161126.0,Freshwater_eel,362.jpg,image/jpeg,139262.0,2012-04-20 09:38:49 UTC,389.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:37 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:28 UTC,,,False,specific,7935.0,True,,,,,,1432.0,,,,3163.0,,,,,223.5,493.0,,0.0,3423.0,,,,,108.5,,,,,0.0,,84.5,,,,544.25,21045.0,0.0,0.0,13305.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.431,,,,634.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,99089.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.268,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.28300000000000003,,,7.004,,,,,,,,,,,15.048,,83.217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.133,,,,,,,,,,,,,-2.780828,12.352644,1

285,365,Emu,Dromaius novaehollandiae,"The emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) is the largest bird native to Australia and the only extant member of the genus Dromaius. It is the second-largest extant bird in the world by height, after its ratite relative, the ostrich. There are three subspecies of emus in Australia. The emu is common over most of mainland Australia, although it avoids heavily populated areas, dense forest, and arid areas. The soft-feathered, brown, flightless birds reach up to 2 metres in height. They have long thin necks and legs. Emus can travel great distances at a fast, economical trot and, if necessary, can sprint at 50Œækm/h . Their long legs allow them to take strides of up to 275 centimetres They are opportunistically nomadic and may travel long distances to find food; they feed on a variety of plants and insects, but have been known to go for weeks without food. Emus ingest stones, glass shards and bits of metal to grind food in the digestive system. They drink infrequently, but take in copious fluids when the opportunity arises. Emus will sit in water and are also able to swim. They are curious birds who are known to follow and watch other animals and humans. Emus do not sleep continuously at night but in several short stints sitting down. Emus use their strongly clawed feet as a defence mechanism. Their legs are among the strongest of any animal, allowing them to rip metal wire fences. They are endowed with good eyesight and hearing, which allows them to detect predators in the vicinity. The plumage varies regionally, matching the surrounding environment and improving its camouflage. The feather structure prevents heat from flowing into the skin, permitting Emus to be active during the midday heat. They can tolerate a wide range of temperatures and thermoregulate effectively. Males and females are hard to distinguish visually, but can be differentiated by the types of loud sounds they emit by manipulating an inflatable neck sac. Emus breed in May and June and are not monogamous; fighting among females for a mate is common. Females can mate several times and lay several batches of eggs in one season. The animals put on weight before the breeding season, and the male does most of the incubation, losing significant weight during this time as he does not eat. The eggs hatch after around eight weeks, and the young are nurtured by their fathers. They reach full size after around six months, but can remain with their family until the next breeding season half a year later. Emus can live between 10 and 20 years in the wild and are predated by dingos, eagles and hawks. They can jump and kick to avoid dingos, but against eagles and hawks, they can only run and swerve. The Tasmanian Emu and King Island Emu subspecies that previously inhabited Tasmania and King Island became extinct after the European settlement of Australia in 1788; and the distribution of the mainland subspecies has been influenced by human activities. Once common on the east coast, emus are now uncommon; by contrast, the development of agriculture and the provision of water for stock in the interior of the continent have increased the range of the emu in arid regions, and it is of Least Concern for conservation. They were a food and fuel source for indigenous Australians and early European settlers. Emus are farmed for their meat, oil, and leather. Emu is a lean meat and while it is often claimed by marketers that the oil has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects, this has not been scientifically verified in humans. The emu is an important cultural icon of Australia. It appears on the coat of arms, various coins, features prominently in Indigenous Australian mythology, and hundreds of places are named after the bird.",174385.0,Emu,365.jpg,image/jpeg,90529.0,2012-04-20 09:42:58 UTC,392.0,Animal foods,Poultry,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:37 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:28 UTC,,,False,specific,8790.0,True,,1.1666666666666667,0.0,,,81.66666666666667,1.5454545454545454,,,860.3333333333334,,,,,294.25,19.166666666666668,,0.0,9.583333333333334,3.727272727272727,,,0.0,57.083333333333336,,1.3636363636363635,,,0.2,,0.0,,,,344.9166666666667,26106.666666666668,0.0,0.0,2400.8333333333335,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8914.170129,,,,312699.72079,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,479.23580000000004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37024.754978,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11022.0934,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,437.5816,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6762.591377,,,7523.013,,,,,,,,,,,5119.04,,14608.712388,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2090.148,,,,,,,,,,,,,25.623764,6.8424172,0

295,375,Greenland halibut/turbot,Reinhardtius hippoglossoides,"The Greenland halibut or Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) belongs to the Pleuronectidae family (the right eye flounders), and is the only species of the genus Reinhardtius. It is a deepwater fish distributed from 200 to 1600 m but has been caught at depths more than 2,200Œæm . It is mainly found in waters with temperatures from 1-4 ŒÁC, but has also observed at sub-zero temperatures down to -2.1 ŒÁC. It has a circumpolar distribution and is found in both the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. Its morphology with the left eye positioned on the dorsal ridge of the forehead gives it an appearance of a cyclops when looking straight at it. The central position of the left eye in the Greenland halibut probably gives it a much wider range of peripheral vision in comparison to other flatfish where the eye has migrated completely. The body shape is elongated and compressed dorsal-ventrally and muscles on both sides are equally developed. Both sides are pigmented; however the left blind side is slightly lighter in color than the right side. Its physical appearance suggests it to be a vigorous swimmer that can swim in a vertical position. Vertical swimming has been observed during tagging experiments. However, video analyzing of Greenland halibut behavior in front of a bottom trawl showed no sign of swimming in a vertical position. Even though most Greenland halibut are caught in bottom fishing gears (trawl, longline and gillnet) they have also been caught in surface drift nets which indicates that they can have a pelagic occurrence. Stomach analysis has also shown that the diet consists mostly of pelagic or bathypelagic organisms. Even though the Greenland halibut is a flatfish it does at times behave more like a roundfish.",172930.0,Greenland halibut,375.jpg,image/jpeg,68044.0,2012-04-20 09:31:59 UTC,402.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:38 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:29 UTC,,,False,specific,111784.0,True,,,,,,2012.0,,,,2730.5,,,,,140.5,49.0,,150.5,2552.5,,,,,69.5,,,,,2245.5,,101.5,,0.0,125.0,661.1428571428571,16395.0,0.0,0.0,15778.333333333332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,23110.325100000002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.27,600.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,793.2802,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,91010.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23.0,,,354.0,,,,,,,,,,,610.03,,77.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,-9.231756,-18.849329,1

In addition, the species classified in the small genera Anyperidon, Cromileptes, Dermatolepis, Gracila, Saloptia, and Triso are also called groupers. Fish in the genus Plectropomus are referred to as coralgroupers. These genera are all classified in the subfamily Epiphelinae. However, some of the hamlets (genus Alphestes), the hinds (genus Cephalopholis), the lyretails (genus Variola) and some other small genera (Gonioplectrus, Niphon, Paranthias) are also in this subfamily, and occasional species in other serranid genera have common names involving the word ""grouper"".

298,378,Guinea hen,Numida meleagris,"The guineafowl (sometimes called guineahen) are a family of birds in the Galliformes order, although some authorities (for example the American Ornithologists' Union) include the guineafowl as a subfamily, Numidinae, of the family Phasianidae. The guineafowl are native to Africa, but the helmeted guineafowl has been domesticated, and both feral and wild-type birds have been introduced elsewhere.This family of insect- and seed-eating, ground-nesting birds resemble partridges, but with featherless heads, though both members of the genus Guttera have a distinctive black crest, and the vulturine guineafowl has a downy brown patch on the nape. Most species of guineafowl have a dark grey or blackish plumage with dense white spots, but both members of the genus Agelastes lack the spots (as do some domestic variants of the helmeted guineafowl). While several species are relatively well known, the plumed guineafowl and the two members of the genus Agelastes remain relatively poorly known.

Haddock is a popular food fish and is widely fished commercially.The haddock is easily recognized by a black lateral line running along its white side (not to be confused with pollock which has the reverse, i.e. white line on black side) and a distinctive dark blotch above the pectoral fin, often described as a ""thumbprint"" or even the ""Devil's thumbprint"" or ""St. Peter's mark"".Haddock is most commonly found at depths of 40 to 133 m (131 to 436 ft), but has a range as deep as 300 m (980 ft). It thrives in temperatures of 2 to 10ŒÁC (36 to 50ŒÁF). Juveniles prefer shallower waters and larger adults deeper water. Generally, adult haddock do not engage in long migratory behaviour as do the younger fish, but seasonal movements have been known to occur across all ages.

301,381,Hazelnut,Corylus,"A hazelnut is the nut of the hazel and is also known as cobnut or filbert nut according to species. A cob is roughly spherical to oval, about 15äóñ25Œæmm long and 10äóñ15Œæmm in diameter, with an outer fibrous husk surrounding a smooth shell. A filbert is more elongated, being about twice as long as it is round. The nut falls out of the husk when ripe, about seven to eight months after pollination. The kernel of the seed is edible and used raw or roasted, or ground into a paste. Hazelnuts are also used for livestock feed, as are chestnuts and acorns. The seed has a thin, dark brown skin, which is sometimes removed before cooking. Hazelnuts are produced in commercial quantities in Turkey, Italy, Greece, Georgia, in south of the Spanish region of Catalonia, in the UK county of Kent and in the American states of Oregon and Washington. Turkey is the largest producer of hazelnuts in the world with approximately 75% of worldwide production. Hazelnuts are used in confectionery to make praline, and also used in combination with chocolate for chocolate truffles and products such as Nutella and Frangelico liqueur. Hazelnut oil, pressed from hazelnuts, is strongly flavoured and used as a cooking oil. Hazelnuts are rich in protein and unsaturated fat. Moreover, they contain significant amounts of thiamine and vitamin B6, as well as smaller amounts of other B vitamins.",19505.0,Hazelnut,381.jpg,image/jpeg,457813.0,2012-04-20 09:40:00 UTC,408.0,Nuts,Nuts,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:38 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:29 UTC,,,False,specific,13450.0,True,0.0,0.0,,,,137.75,,,,54379.25,,,,,7958.75,51.25,,0.0,95.75,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1837.0,11714.0,8090.0,21752.0,58379.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,520.7339999999999,0.0,0.0,0.0,185910.87043000004,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,85.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,311.0,406.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.25,,0.0,,105600.0522,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,94.73709999999998,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,788.0,91.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,40.919,1531.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,360.008,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,474.80699999999996,,0.0,372.93,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,7237.0,,1085.10102,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.041,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,1056.6970000000001,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,2.0,,0.0,0.0,18.943806,6.112364,16

Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse.

311,391,Java plum,Syzygium cumini,"Syzygium cumini, jambul, jambolan, jamblang, or jamun, is an evergreen tropical tree in the flowering plant family Myrtaceae. Syzygium cumini is native to Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The name of the fruit is sometimes mistranslated as blackberry, which is a different fruit in an unrelated family.The tree was introduced to Florida, USA in 1911 by the USDA, and is also now commonly grown in Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago. In Brazil, where it was introduced from India during Portuguese colonization, it has dispersed spontaneously in the wild in some places, as its fruits are eagerly sought by various native birds such as thrushes, tanagers and the Great Kiskadee. This species is considered an invasive in Hawaii, USA. It is also illegal to grow, plant or transplant in Sanibel, Florida.The fruits develop by May or June and resemble large berries. The fruit is oblong, ovoid, starts green and turns pink to shining crimson black as it matures. A variant of the tree produces white coloured fruit. The fruit has a combination of sweet, mildly sour and astringent flavour and tends to colour the tongue purple.",505419.0,Syzgium_cumini,391.jpg,image/jpeg,30417.0,2012-04-20 09:43:27 UTC,418.0,Fruits,Tropical fruits,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:39 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:29 UTC,,,False,specific,260142.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,155.5,720.0,,33855.0,600.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,14478.9,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,686.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,10.0,1708.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,1190.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,87.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0001,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,21.0015,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,,,,,,0.0,,0.705,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1400.0,,0.0,0.0,-17.132608,-17.627642,12

314,394,Jute,Corchorus olitorius,"Jute is a long, soft, shiny vegetable fiber that can be spun into coarse, strong threads. It is produced from plants in the genus Corchorus, which was once classified with the family Tiliaceae, more recently with Malvaceae, and has now been reclassified as belonging to the family Sparrmanniaceae. ""Jute"" is the name of the plant or fiber that is used to make burlap, Hessian or gunny cloth.In Nigeria, leaves of Corchorus olitorius are prepared in sticky soup called ewedu together with ingredients such as sweet potato, dried small fish or shrimp. The leaves are rubbed until foamy or sticky before adding to the soup. The leaves of the Jute plant are widely used in Nigeria, to prepare a sticky soup. Amongst the Yoruba of Nigeria, the leaves are called Ewedu, and in the hausa speaking northern Nigeria, the leaves are called turgunuwa, or, lallo. The jute leaves are cut into shreds and added to the soup which would normally contain other ingredients such as meat, and/or fish, pepper, onions, and other spices. Likewise, the Lugbara of Northwestern Uganda eat the leaves as soup, locally called pala bi.

The first (spiny) dorsal fin is entirely colorless and is normally folded back into a body groove, as are the pelvic fins. The lateral line starts high on the shoulder, dips abruptly at mid-body and then continues as a wavy horizontal line to the tail. Coloration is olive on the back, fading to silver with a rosy iridescence on the sides, fading to white on the belly. Fish under 10 pounds (5 kg) show yellowish-brown spots on the flanks, somewhat smaller than the spots of the Atlantic Spanish mackerel, Scomberomorus maculatus.

An ocean fish whose habitat is in the Atlantic region and can be found around Iceland, Faroe Islands, British Isles, the Norse coast and occasionally around Newfoundland, the ling has a long slender body that can reach 2Œæmetres in length; in adulthood, it is generally a deep-running fish, spending much of its life at depths of 100Œæm or more; younger fish are found at shallower depths. The ling is edible; its flesh is prized and can be considered interchangeable with cod in either its fresh, salted or dried forms. The salted roe of the ling is considered a delicacy in Spain and is known as huevas de maruca.

326,407,Sacred lotus,Nelumbo nucifera,"Nelumbo nucifera, known by numerous common names including Indian lotus, sacred lotus, bean of India, or simply lotus, is one of two species of aquatic plant in the family Nelumbonaceae. The Linnaean binomial Nelumbo nucifera (Gaertn.) is the currently recognized name for this species, which has been classified under the former names, Nelumbium speciosum (Willd.) and Nymphaea nelumbo, among others. Names other than Nelumbo nucifera (Gaertn.) are obsolete synonyms and should not be used in current works. This plant is an aquatic perennial. Under favorable circumstances its seeds may remain viable for many years, with the oldest recorded lotus germination being from that of seeds 1,300 years old recovered from a dry lakebed in northeastern China.A common misconception is referring to the lotus as a water lily (Nymphaea), an entirely different plant, as can be seen in the center of the flowers. Nymphaea lacks the structure that goes on to form the distinctive circular seed pod in the Nelumbo nucifera.Native to Tropical Asia and Queensland, Australia, it is commonly cultivated in water gardens.

329,410,Mammee apple,Mammea americana,"The mammee apple is a berry, though it is often misinterpreted to be a drupe. It is round or slightly irregular, with a brown or grey-brown 3 mm (0.12 in) thick rind. In fact, the rind consists of the exocarp and mesocarp of the fruit, while the pulp is formed from the endocarp. The stem is thick and short. The mammee apple has more or less visible floral remnant at the apex.Mammee apples' diameter ranges from 10 cm (3.9 in) to 20 cm (7.9 in). When unripe, the fruit is hard and heavy, but its flesh slightly softens when fully ripe. Beneath the skin, there is a white, dry membrane, whose taste is astringent, that adheres to the flesh.

330,411,Purple mangosteen,Garcinia mangostana,"The purple mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana), colloquially known simply as mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree believed to have originated in the Sunda Islands and the Moluccas of Indonesia. It grows mainly in Southeast Asia, and also in tropical South American countries such as Colombia, in the state of Kerala in India and in Puerto Rico, where the tree has been introduced. The tree grows from 6 to 25 m (19.7 to 82.0 ft) tall. The fruit of the mangosteen is sweet and tangy, juicy, somewhat fibrous, with fluid-filled vesicles (like the flesh of citrus fruits), with an inedible, deep reddish-purple colored rind (exocarp) when ripe. In each fruit, the fragrant edible flesh that surrounds each seed is botanically endocarp, i.e., the inner layer of the ovary. Seeds are almond-shaped and sized.The edible endocarp of the mangosteen has the same shape and size as a tangerine 4?6 centimetres (1.6?2.4 in) in diameter, but is white. The circle of wedge-shaped segments contains 4?8, rarely 9 segments, the larger ones harbouring apomictic seeds that are unpalatable unless roasted.The purple mangosteen belongs to the same genus as the other, less widely known, mangosteens, such as the button mangosteen (G. prainiana) or the charichuelo (G. madruno).",21484.0,Purple_mangosteen,411.jpg,image/jpeg,63989.0,2012-04-20 09:44:21 UTC,438.0,Fruits,Tropical fruits,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:40 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:29 UTC,,,False,specific,58228.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,189.0,410.0,1800.0,36530.0,1790.0,0.0,,,3323.0442000000003,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,49.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,485.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.17,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,148.0,0.0,0.0,,82.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.35,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,194.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,9.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,11.011,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049,,,,,,0.0,,1.045,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.2,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.011,,,,,,,0.006,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-18.77681,-18.722591,12
331,412,Alpine sweetvetch,Hedysarum alpinum,"Hedysarum alpinum is a species of flowering plant in the legume family known by the common name alpine sweetvetch. It has a circumpolar distribution, occurring throughout the northern latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. In North America it is widespread in Canada and the northernmost United States, including Alaska. This plant is a perennial herb producing several erect stems from its caudex. It grows to 70Œæcentimetres in height. The taproot is thick and woody, and it has rhizomes which can produce new stems. The leaves are each divided into a number of leaflets up to 3.5Œæcentimetres long. The inflorescence is a dense raceme of flowers. The flowers are pink or pale purple and up to 1.5Œæcentimetres long. The flowers are pollinated by insects such as the bumblebee and honeybee. The fruit is a flat legume pod which is narrowed between the seeds, with as many as 9 segments. This plant generally grows in the boreal and northern temperate climates. It occurs in tundra and taiga habitat types, in floodplains, grasslands, and dry forests. It is well adapted to calcareous soils. It is usually not a dominant species but it is considered dominant in several river deltas and plains in Alaska. It is a pioneer species on floodplains that have been recently scoured by water and ice. It grows with willows and birches along waterways and in forests dominated by spruces. It grows on grasslands with grass species such as little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), Canada bluegrass (Poa compressa), and American dunegrass (Leymus mollis). Alpine sweetvetch is an important source of food for many types of animals, including black bears, grizzly bears, American bison, moose, Dall's sheep, and caribou. Bears are adept at digging up the nutritious roots. The roots are a primary food for grizzly bears in some areas, such as Banff National Park. In parts of Alaska this plant is a primary food for Dall's sheep and caribou. Many small mammals, such as voles and short-tailed weasels eat it, and a variety of birds nest in alpine sweetvetch habitat. Native Alaskan peoples used and still use the plant for food, particularly the fleshy roots. The roots are said to taste like young carrots. The Inupiat people call the plant wild potato and obtain dietary fiber from the roots. Alpine sweetvetch is the most important food source for the Dena'ina people after wild fruit species. The Eskimo train dogs to locate stores of roots that have been cached by mice. The roots may be eaten raw or prepared in a number of ways, including boiling, roasting, and frying in grease. They are stored in lard or oil and eaten when other food stores run out.",26723.0,Hedysarum alpinum,412.jpg,image/jpeg,320993.0,2012-04-20 09:33:46 UTC,439.0,Vegetables,Root vegetables,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:40 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:29 UTC,,,False,specific,57576.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,350.5,5800.0,,22600.0,2400.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,10908.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,216.3,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,53.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.102,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,3145.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,1319.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-17.886429,-14.606595,22

333,414,Monkfish,Lophius piscatorius,"Monkfish (or headfish) is the English name of a number of types of fish in the northwest Atlantic, most notably the species of the anglerfish genus Lophius and the angelshark genus Squatina. The term is also occasionally used for a European sea monster more often called a sea monk. Monkfish is the most common English name for the genus Lophius in the northeast Atlantic but goosefish is used as the equivalent term on the eastern coast of North America. Lophius has three long filaments sprouting from the middle of the head; these are the detached and modified three first spines of the anterior dorsal fin. As in most anglerfish species, the longest filament is the first (illicium), which terminates in an irregular growth of flesh, the esca. This modified fin ray is movable in all directions. This esca is used as a lure to attract other fishes, which monkfish then typically swallow whole. Experiments have shown that whether the prey has been attracted to the lure or not is not strictly relevant, as the action of the jaws is an automatic reflex triggered by contact with the esca. It grows to a length of more than 1.5Œæm (5Œæft); specimens of 1Œæm (3Œæft) are common. The largest recorded specimen weighed 115 kg (253 lb) and was caught on January 7, 2012, by Frank-Rune Kopperud of Norway.

334,415,Moose,Alces alces,"The moose (North America) or Eurasian elk (Europe) (Alces alces) is the largest extant species in the deer family. Moose are distinguished by the palmate antlers of the males; other members of the family have antlers with a dendritic (""twig-like"") configuration. Moose typically inhabit boreal and mixed deciduous forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates. Moose used to have a much wider range but hunting and other human activities greatly reduced it over the years. Moose have been reintroduced to some of their former habitats. Currently, most moose are found in Canada, Alaska, Scandinavia and Russia. Their diet consists of both terrestrial and aquatic vegetation. The most common moose predators are wolves, bears, and humans. Unlike most other deer species, moose are solitary animals and do not form herds. Although generally slow-moving and sedentary, moose can become aggressive and move surprisingly quickly if angered or startled. Their mating season in the autumn can lead to spectacular fights between males competing for a female.",180703.0,Moose,415.jpg,image/jpeg,236967.0,2012-04-20 09:36:51 UTC,442.0,Animal foods,Venison,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:40 UTC,2017-06-08 01:36:16 UTC,,,False,specific,9852.0,False,,,,,,10.0,,,,160.0,,,,,243.33333333333334,327.5,,0.0,0.0,,,,,80.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,320.25,24547.5,0.0,857.5,2025.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1946.0,,,,692.0809999999999,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1899.192,0.158,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1719.1399999999999,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.0071,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,99.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3506.0,,,784.0,,,,,,,,,,,182.0009,,93939.948,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-38.105495,-14.679532,0

The name komatsuna is from the Japanese komatsuna, ""small pine tree greens"". It is stir-fried, pickled, boiled, and added to soups or used fresh in salads. It is an excellent source of calcium.The leaves of komatsuna may be eaten at any stage of their growth. In a mature plant they are dark green with slender light green stalks, around 30 centimeters (12"") long and 18 cm (7"") wide.

341,422,New Zealand spinach,Tetragonia tetragonioides,"Tetragonia tetragonioides (or previously T. expansa) is a leafy groundcover also known as New Zealand spinach, Warrigal greens, kokihi, sea spinach, Botany Bay spinach, tetragon and Cook's cabbage. It is native to New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Chile and Argentina. The species, rarely used by Maori or other indigenous people as a leaf vegetable, was first mentioned by Captain Cook. It was immediately picked, cooked, and pickled to help fight scurvy, and taken with the crew of the Endeavour. It spread when the explorer and botanist Joseph Banks took seeds back to Kew Gardens during the latter half of the 18th century. For two centuries, T. tetragonioides was the only cultivated vegetable to have originated from Australia and New Zealand. The species prefers a moist environment for growth. The plant has a trailing habit, and will form a thick carpet on the ground or climb though other vegetation and hang downwards. The leaves of the plant are 3äóñ15Œæcm long, triangular in shape, and bright green. The leaves are thick, and covered with tiny papillae that look like waterdrops on the top and bottom of the leaves. The flowers of the plant are yellow, and the fruit is a small, hard pod covered with small horns.

342,423,Nopal,Opuntia cochenillifera,"Nopales (for the pads) are a vegetable made from the young cladode (pad) segments of prickly pear, carefully peeled to remove the spines. These fleshy pads are flat and about hand-sized. They can be purple or green. They are particularly common in their native Mexico, where the plant is eaten commonly and regularly forms part of a variety of Mexican cuisine dishes. Farmed nopales are most often of the species Opuntia ficus-indica, although the pads of almost all Opuntia species are edible. Nopales are generally sold fresh in Mexico. In more recent years bottled, or canned versions are available mostly for export. Less often dried versions are available. Used to prepare nopalitos, they have a light, slightly tart flavor, like green beans, and a crisp, mucilaginous texture. In most recipes the mucilaginous liquid they contain is included in the cooking. They are at their most tender and juicy in the spring. Nopales are most commonly used in Mexican cuisine in dishes such as huevos con nopales, carne con nopales (meat with nopal), tacos de nopales, or simply on their own or in salads with queso panela (panela cheese). Candied nopale is called acitrí_ne. Nopales have also grown to be an important ingredient in New Mexican cuisine and in Tejano culture (Texas).",19699.0,Nopal,423.jpg,image/jpeg,94830.0,2012-04-20 09:33:50 UTC,450.0,Vegetables,Other vegetables,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:40 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:30 UTC,,,False,specific,338184.0,True,,,,,,1.0,,,,12.0,,,,,31.5,3.5,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,40.5,1335.0,2100.0,3305.0,70.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,13200.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20126.606700000004,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,51.5,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,554.033,203.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,9612.16522,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.4,770.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,7.248,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,595.002,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,2290.0,,0.0,51848.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,7540.0,,80398.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,2073.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-39.699142,-15.069122,22
343,424,Ocean pout,Zoarces americanus,"The ocean pout (Zoarces americanus) is an eelpout in the family Zoarcidae. It is found in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of New England and eastern Canada. The fish has antifreeze proteins in its blood, giving it the ability to survive in near-freezing waters. Scientists have done studies wherein genes are taken from the ocean pout and implanted into salmon in an attempt to make the latter grow faster. These genes transfer the ocean pout's tolerance for extremely cold waters to the salmon, allowing it to grow year-round. The promoter for the antifreeze protein gene is also used in conjunction with the growth hormone taken from a chinook salmon, which leads to a higher concentration of the growth hormone in the blood; causing the genetically modified salmon to grow much more rapidly than it would naturally. Controversy has arisen, as some view the altered fish as a potential threat to wild salmon stocks if it escapes or is ever released into the wild. Chefs and grocers in numerous US states have agreed not to sell the new fish over these concerns, citing concerns over its safety for human consumption. In June 2006 the Unilever company announced that it would use genetically modified yeast to grow antifreeze proteins based on a gene from the ocean pout, and use it to improve the consistency and storage properties of its ice cream brands.",630979.0,Ocean pout,424.jpg,image/jpeg,76754.0,2012-04-20 09:35:10 UTC,451.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:41 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:30 UTC,,,False,specific,8199.0,True,,,,,,93.5,,,,282.0,,,,,36.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,234.75,18985.0,0.0,0.0,1040.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,27117.21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,230.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1022.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,277.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,17.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,348.0014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-29.765137,3.226645,1

347,430,Ostrich,Struthio camelus,"The Ostrich or Common Ostrich (Struthio camelus) is either one or two species of large flightless birds native to Africa, the only living member(s) of the genus Struthio, which is in the ratite family. Some analyses indicate that the Somali Ostrich may be better considered a full species separate from the Common Ostrich, but most taxonomists consider it to be a subspecies. The ostrich shares the order Struthioniformes with the kiwis, emus, rheas, and cassowaries. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs, and can run at up to about 70Œækm/h, the fastest land speed of any bird. The ostrich is the largest living species of bird and lays the largest eggs of any living bird (extinct elephant birds of Madagascar and the giant moa of New Zealand laid larger eggs). The ostrich's diet consists mainly of plant matter, though it also eats invertebrates. It lives in nomadic groups of 5 to 50 birds. When threatened, the ostrich will either hide itself by lying flat against the ground, or run away. If cornered, it can attack with a kick of its powerful legs. Mating patterns differ by geographical region, but territorial males fight for a harem of two to seven females. The ostrich is farmed around the world, particularly for its feathers, which are decorative and are also used as feather dusters. Its skin is used for leather products and its meat is marketed commercially.",174375.0,Ostrich,430.jpg,image/jpeg,174017.0,2012-04-20 09:41:41 UTC,457.0,Animal foods,Poultry,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:41 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:30 UTC,,,False,specific,8801.0,True,,3.0,0.0,,,247.5,5.5,,,961.6111111111111,,,,,385.3888888888889,32.05555555555556,,0.0,14.8,3.75,,,0.0,122.33333333333333,,1.5,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,352.44444444444446,24553.333333333332,0.0,0.0,3451.6666666666665,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1012.9321,,,,254133.313306,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7581.439667000001,5.2e-05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,109651.22965800001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13188.87,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7405.115602,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23677.140152,,,92014.06080300001,,,,,,,,,,,2386.020908,,15228.908782,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3504.10511,,,,,,,,,,,,,23.340052,7.9311337,0

349,432,Pacific herring,Clupea pallasii,"The Pacific herring, Clupea pallasii, is a species of the herring family associated with the Pacific Ocean environment of North America and northeast Asia. It is a silvery fish with unspined fins and a deeply forked caudal fin. The distribution is widely along the California coast from Baja California north to Alaska and the Bering Sea; in Asia the distribution is south to Japan. Clupea pallasii is considered a keystone species because of its very high productivity and interactions with a large number of predators and prey. Pacific herring spawn in variable seasons, but often in the early part of the year in intertidal and sub-tidal environments, commonly on eelgrass or other submerged vegetation; however, they do not die after spawning, but can breed in successive years. According to government sources, the Pacific herring fishery collapsed in the year 1993, and is slowly recovering to commercial viability in several North American stock areas. The species is named for Peter Simon Pallas, a noted German naturalist and explorer. There are disjunct populations of Clupea pallasii in North-East Europe, which are often attributed to separate subspecies Clupea pallasii marisalbi (White Sea herring) and Clupea pallasii suworowi (Chosha herring).",551209.0,Pacific herring,432.jpg,image/jpeg,40137.0,2012-04-20 09:30:36 UTC,459.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:41 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:30 UTC,,,False,specific,30724.0,True,,,,,,1206.0,,,,3323.5,,,,,156.0,46.666666666666664,,283.0,1550.5,,,,,109.5,,,,,1702.0,,196.0,,,,684.4,30380.0,0.0,1454.0,14960.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28.073,,,,185221.28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9976.403,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,547.338,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,49.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9.209,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,12.975800000000001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24.188683,0.7000503,1

Pepper cultivars in Capsicum frutescens can be annual or short-lived perennial plants. Flowers are white with a greenish white or greenish yellow corolla, and are either insect- or self-pollinated. The plants' berries typically grow erect; ellipsoid-conical to lanceoloid shaped. They are usually very small and pungent, growing 10?20mm long and 3?7mm in diameter. Fruit typically grows a pale yellow and matures to a bright red, but can also be other colors. C. frutescens has a smaller variety of shapes compared to other Capsicum species, likely because of the lack of human selection. More recently, however, C. frutescens has been bred to produce ornamental strains, because of its large quantities of erect peppers growing in colorful ripening patterns.",527044.0,Capsicum_frutescens,436.jpg,image/jpeg,80619.0,2012-04-20 09:39:22 UTC,463.0,Vegetables,Fruit vegetables,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:41 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:30 UTC,,2.0,False,specific,40321.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8710.0,,46800.0,6683.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,1930.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,0.0,283.95,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,55.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.09309999999999999,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,8.001,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,56.0,0.002,1298.9669999999999,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200.0,75.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.012,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,22.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,1300.23,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,13000.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,84390.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-11.13977,-6.1237006,22

355,439,Northern pike,Esox lucius,"The northern pike (Esox lucius), known simply as a pike in Britain, Ireland, Canada, and most parts of the USA, also called jackfish or simply ""northern"" in the Upper Midwest of the USA), is a species of carnivorous fish of the genus Esox (the pikes). They are typical of brackish and fresh waters of the Northern Hemisphere (i.e. holarctic in distribution). Pike grow to a relatively large size; lengths of 150 cm (59 in) and weights of 25 kg (55 lb) are not rare. The average length is about 70-120 cm (28-47 in). The heaviest specimen known so far was caught in 1983 at an abandoned stone quarry in Germany, where the species is known as a Hecht. She (the majority of all pikes over 8 kg or 18 lb are females) was 147 cm (58 in) long and weighed 31 kg (68 lb). The longest pike ever recorded and confirmed was 152 cm (60 in) long and weighed 28 kg (62 lb). A pike of 60.5 in (154 cm) was caught and released in May 2004 in Apisko Lake, Manitoba. Historic reports of giant pike, caught in nets in Ireland in the late 19th century, of 41-42 kg (90-93 lb) with a length of 173-175 cm (67-68 in), were researched by Fred Buller and published in The Domesday Book of Mammoth Pike.

356,440,Pili nut,Canarium ovatum,"Canarium ovatum, commonly known as pili, is a species of tropical tree belonging to the genus Canarium. It is one of approximately 600 species in the family Burseraceae. Pili are native to maritime Southeast Asia, Papua New Guinea, and Northern Australia. They are commercially cultivated in the Philippines for their edible nuts.The pili fruit is a drupe, 4 to 7 cm (1.6 to 2.8 in) long, 2.3 to 3.8 cm (0.91 to 1.50 in) in diameter, and weighs 15.7 to 45.7 g (0.035 to 0.101 lb). The skin (exocarp) is smooth, thin, shiny, and turns purplish black when the fruit ripens; the pulp (mesocarp) is fibrous, fleshy, and greenish yellow in color, and the hard shell (endocarp) within protects a normally dicotyledonous embryo. The basal end of the shell (endocarp) is pointed and the apical end is more or less blunt; between the seed and the hard shell (endocarp) is a thin, brownish, fibrous seed coat developed from the inner layer of the endocarp.

364,449,Prickly pear,Opuntia,"Opuntia, also known as nopales or paddle cactus, is a genus in the cactus family, Cactaceae. Currently, only prickly pears are included in this genus of about 200 species distributed throughout most of the Americas. Chollas are now separated into the genus Cylindropuntia, which some still consider a subgenus of Opuntia. Austrocylindropuntia, Corynopuntia, and Micropuntia are also often included in the present genus, but like Cylindropuntia, they seem rather distinct. Brasiliopuntia and Miqueliopuntia are closer relatives of Opuntia.The most common culinary species is the Indian fig opuntia (O. ficus-indica). Most culinary uses of the term ""prickly pear"" refer to this species. Prickly pears are also known as tuna (fruit) or nopal (paddle, plural nopales) from the Nahuatl word n?palli for the pads, or nostle, from the Nahuatl word n?chtli for the fruit; or paddle cactus.The genus is named for the Ancient Greek city of Opus, where, according to Theophrastus, an edible plant grew which could be propagated by rooting its leaves.",19686.0,Opuntia,449.jpg,image/jpeg,6241.0,2012-04-20 09:38:34 UTC,476.0,Fruits,Tropical fruits,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:42 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:30 UTC,,,False,specific,106975.0,True,,,,,,2.0,,,,72.0,,,,,186.0,23.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,124.66666666666667,730.0,3600.0,8390.0,505.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,32.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,1991.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,77322.99,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,247.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,40.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,213.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,111.0,,0.0,71.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,103.0,,550.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,2030.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,99.0,,0.0,0.0,-3.7726705,9.863691,12

366,451,European rabbit,Oryctolagus,"The European rabbit or common rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a species of rabbit native to southwestern Europe (Spain and Portugal) and northwest Africa (Morocco and Algeria). It has been widely introduced elsewhere, often with devastating effects on local biodiversity. However, its decline in its native range (caused by the diseases myxomatosis and rabbit calicivirus, as well as overhunting and habitat loss), has caused the decline of its highly dependent predators, the Iberian lynx and the Spanish Imperial eagle. It is known as an invasive species because it has been introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica and sub-Saharan Africa, and caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. Australia has the most problems with European rabbits, due to the lack of natural predators there.The European rabbit is well known for digging networks of burrows, called warrens, where it spends most of its time when not feeding. Unlike the related hares (Lepus spp.), rabbits are altricial, the young being born blind and furless, in a fur-lined nest in the warren, and they are totally dependent upon their mother.

Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates against cold weather. Two of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws and its facial mask, which are themes in the mythology of several Native American tribes. Raccoons are noted for their intelligence, with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for up to three years.

Its distribution is circumpolar, and it has been introduced to the Great Lakes, and from there has made its way to various other places. Walleye, trout, and other larger fish prey on these smelt. The rainbow smelt prefer juvenile ciscoes, zooplankton, and other small organisms. They are anadromous spring spawners and prefer clean streams with light flow and light siltation. The rainbow smelt face several barriers. They are weak swimmers and cannot overcome most fish ladders. This prevents them from making it past the dams to the headwater streams where they spawn. The rise in erosion and dams help to decimate the smelt population in the 1980s. There are currently plans to try to reduce damming and to help control erosion.

373,458,Orange roughy,Hoplostethus atlanticus,"The orange roughy, red roughy, slimehead or deep sea perch, Hoplostethus atlanticus, is a relatively large deep-sea fish belonging to the slimehead family (Trachichthyidae). The Marine Conservation Society has categorized orange roughy as vulnerable to exploitation. It is found in 3 to 9 ŒÁC (37Œæto 48ŒæŒÁF) deep (bathypelagic, 180 to 1,800 metres waters of the Western Pacific Ocean, eastern Atlantic Ocean, Indo-Pacific, and in the Eastern Pacific off Chile. The orange roughy is notable for its extraordinary lifespan, with lifespans up to 149 years determined by scientific methods. It is important to commercial deep trawl fisheries. The fish is actually a bright, brick red color; however, the orange roughy fades to a yellowish orange after death. Like other slimeheads, the orange roughy is slow-growing and late to mature, resulting in a very low resilience. They are extremely susceptible to overfishing because of this, and many stocks have already crashed; recently discovered substitute stocks are rapidly dwindling. The flesh is firm with a mild flavour; it is sold skinned and filleted, fresh or frozen.",166139.0,Orange roughy,458.jpg,image/jpeg,44101.0,2012-04-20 09:30:29 UTC,485.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:42 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:30 UTC,,,False,specific,96778.0,True,,0.5,0.0,,,41.5,0.0,,,223.5,,,,,44.5,1.5,,1.0,53.5,53.0,,,0.0,15.0,,0.0,,,20.5,,1.0,,,,235.0,19525.0,0.0,0.0,800.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33.0,,,,10189.324800000002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.032,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4026.1515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35.92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1395.216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,503.0,,,14.0,,,,,,,,,,,2357.51,,36.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,598.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-29.504887,0.86417365,1
374,459,Sablefish,Anoplopoma fimbria,"The sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, is one of two members of the fish family Anoplopomatidae and the only species in the Anoplopoma genus. In English, common names for it include sable (USA), black cod (USA, UK, Canada), blue cod (UK), bluefish (UK), candlefish (UK), coal cod (UK), coalfish (Canada), beshow, and skil(fish) (Canada), although many of these names also refer to other, unrelated, species. In the USA, the FDA accepts only ""sablefish"" as the Acceptable Market Name; ""black cod"" is considered a vernacular (regional) name and should not be used as a Statement of Identity for this species. The sablefish is found in muddy sea beds in the North Pacific at depths of 300 to 2,700 m (1000 to 9000 ft) and is commercially important to Japan.The white flesh of the sablefish is soft-textured and mildly flavored. It is considered a delicacy in many countries. When cooked, its flaky texture is similar to Patagonian toothfish (Chilean sea bass). The meat has a high fat content and can be prepared in many ways, including grilling, smoking, or frying, or served as sushi. Sablefish flesh is high in long-chain omega 3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA.

After returning to their spawning streams, their coloring changes to pale grey on the back with yellowish-white belly (although some turn an overall dull green color). As with all salmon, in addition to the dorsal fin, they also have an adipose fin. The fish is characterized by a white mouth with black gums, no teeth on the tongue, large oval-shaped black spots on the back, a v-shaped tail, and an anal fin with 13-17 soft rays. During their spawning migration, males develop a pronounced humped back, hence their nickname ""humpies"". Pink salmon average 4.8 pounds (2.2 kg) in weight.

The name Chum salmon comes from the Chinook Jargon term tzum, meaning ""spotted"" or ""marked"", while ""Keta"" comes from the Evenki language of Eastern Siberia via Russian.The body of the chum salmon is deeper than most salmonid species. In common with other species found in the Pacific, the anal fin has 12 to 20 rays, compared with a maximum of 12 in European species. Chum have an ocean coloration of silvery blue green with some indistinct spotting in a darker shade, and a rather paler belly. When they move into fresh water the color changes to dark olive green and the belly color deepens. When adults are near spawning, they have purple blotchy streaks near the caudal peduncle, darker towards the tail. Spawning males typically grow an elongated snout or kype, their lower fins become tipped with white and they have enlarged teeth.

A distinguishing feature of the sockeye salmon is the lack of a definite spot on the back and tail. Juveniles remain in freshwater until they are ready to migrate to the ocean, over distances of up to 1,600 km. Their diet consists primarily of zooplankton. Sockeye salmon are semelparous, dying after they spawn.The sockeye salmon is sometimes called red or blueback salmon, due to its hue. Sockeye are blue tinged with silver in color while living in the ocean. When they return to spawning grounds, their bodies become red and their heads turn green. Sockeye can be anywhere from 60 to 84 centimeters in length and weigh from 2.3 to 7 kg.

384,469,Mamey sapote,Pouteria sapota,"The mamey sapote (Pouteria sapota) is a species of tree native to southern Mexico. Today, the tree is cultivated not only in Mexico, but also in Central America, the Caribbean, and South Florida for its fruit, which is commonly eaten in many Latin American countries. Mamey sapote is a large and highly ornamental evergreen tree that can reach a height of 15 to 45 meters (60 to 140 feet) at maturity. Like most fruit trees, it is mainly propagated by grafting, which ensures the new plant has the same characteristics as the parent, especially its fruit. It is also considerably faster than growing trees by seed. The fruit is about 10 to 25Œæcm (4 to 10 inches) long and 8 to 12Œæcm (3 to 5 inches) wide and has orange flesh. The fruit is eaten raw or made into milkshakes, smoothies, ice cream and fruit bars. It can be used to produce marmalade and jelly. Some consider the fruit to be an aphrodisiac. Some beauty products use oil pressed from the seed, otherwise known as sapayul oil. The brown skin has a texture somewhat between sandpaper and the fuzz on a peach. The fruit's texture is creamy and soft. A mamey sapote is ripe when the flesh is pink when a fleck of the skin is removed. The flesh should give slightly, as with a ripe kiwifruit. The mamey sapote is related to other sapotes such as sapodilla, abiu (P. caimito) and canistel (P. campechiana), but unrelated to the black sapote and white sapote. It should not be confused with the mammee apple.

390,476,Bearded seal,Erignathus barbatus,"The bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), also called the square flipper seal, is a medium-sized pinniped that is found in and near to the Arctic Ocean. Distinguishing features of this earless seal include square fore flippers and thick bristles on its muzzle. Adults are greyish-brown in colour, darker on the back; rarely with a few faint spots on the back or dark spots on the sides. Occasionally the face and neck are reddish-brown. Bearded seal pups are born with a greyish-brown natal fur with scattered patches of white on the back and head. The bearded seal is unique in the subfamily Phocinae in having two pairs of teats, a feature it shares with monk seals.Bearded seals reach about 2.1 m (6.9 ft) to 2.7 m (8.9 ft) in nose-to-tail length and from 200 kg (441 lb) to 430 kg (948 lb) in weight. Both sexes are about the same size.Bearded seals are a primary food source for polar bears and a secondary source for the Inuit of the Arctic coast. The Inuit language name for the seal is ugjuk (plural: ugjuit) or oogrook or oogruk.

394,481,Shark,Squaliformes,"Sharks are a group of fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the rays. However, the term ""shark"" has also been used for extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii outside the Selachimorpha, such as Cladoselache and Xenacanthus. Under this broader definition, the earliest known sharks date from more than 420 million years ago.Since then, sharks have diversified into over 470 species. They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi), a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres (6.7 in) in length, to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately 12 metres (39 ft). Sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). They generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river shark, which can survive in both seawater and freshwater. They breathe through five to seven gill slits. Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have several sets of replaceable teeth.Well-known species such as the great white shark, tiger shark, blue shark, mako shark, and the hammerhead shark are apex predators?organisms at the top of their underwater food chain.",160602.0,Shark,481.jpg,image/jpeg,65426.0,2012-04-20 09:30:18 UTC,508.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:44 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:31 UTC,,,False,specific,282414.0,True,,,,,,238.0,,,,3097.5,,,,,1338.0,109.0,,28.0,241.5,,,,,100.0,,,,,281.5,,99.0,,,,464.0,19800.0,0.0,3195.0,9165.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8.0,,,,470.69140000000004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26.018,0.17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,623.1342000000001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,63.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22181.2,,,35.37,,,,,,,,,,,63.107,,638.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-25.636591,1.6592498,1

Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name ""sheep"" applies to many species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a ewe (/ju?/), an intact male as a ram or occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a younger sheep as a lamb.Domestic sheep are relatively small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral. Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic as a result of selective breeding by humans. A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only.

406,493,Strawberry guava,Psidium cattleianum,"Psidium cattleianum, named in honour of notable English horticulturist William Cattley, commonly known as Cattley guava or Peruvian guava, is a small tree (2?6 m tall), bearing small red or yellow fruit, which are somewhat sour but sometimes eaten or made into jam. The red-fruited variety, PSIDIUM LITTORALE Var. Longipes, is known as strawberry guava; the yellow-fruited variety, PSIDIUM LITTORALE Var. Littorale (Lucidum) is variously known as lemon guava, """"Yellow-fruited Cherry Guava"""", and in Hawaii as waiaw? and is usually smaller. Native to Brazil and adjacent tropical South America, it is closely related to common guava (P. guajava), and like that species is a widespread, highly invasive species in tropical areas, especially Hawai?i. It tends to form dense, monotypic stands which prevent regrowth of native species, and is very difficult to eradicate; it also provides refuge for fruit flies which cause extensive agricultural damage. As an invasive species, it is sometimes erroneously called Chinese guava. Cherry Guava is sporadically naturalised in coastal areas of Queensland and northern New South Wales. It is also naturalised on Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island and Christmas Island (Navie 2004; Queensland Herbarium 2008).The yellow variety bears even more heavily than the red and generally has larger fruit. The fruit can be eaten whole as both the thin skin and soft, juicy interior are edible. Strawberry guavas taste like a passionfruit mixed with strawberry; the yellow variety lacks the astringency of the red and is preferred by some people.  The skin is also edible and tastes a bit like rose petals but is often removed for a sweeter flavour. The seeds are small and white in colour and can be roasted as a substitute for coffee. Its leaves may be brewed for tea.",27239.0,Strawberry_guava,493.jpg,image/jpeg,44892.0,2012-04-20 09:33:34 UTC,520.0,Fruits,Berries,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:44 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:31 UTC,,,False,specific,375274.0,True,,,,,,3.0,,,,52.0,,,,,182.0,71.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,179.0,580.0,5400.0,35780.0,1200.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,83467.62560000003,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,19.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,7.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,550.015,0.015,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,230.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,6098.001,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,,,,,,0.0,,8724.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,15.901798,-7.518268,12

408,495,White sucker,Catostomus commersonii,"The white sucker (Catostomus commersonii) is a freshwater Cypriniform fish inhabiting the upper Midwest and Northeast in North America, but is also found as far south as Georgia and New Mexico in the south. The fish is commonly known as a ""sucker"" due to its fleshy papillose lips that suck up organic matter from the bottom of rivers and streams.Other common names for the white sucker include bay fish, brook sucker, common sucker, and mullet. The white sucker is often confused with the longnose sucker (Catostomus catostomus), because they look very similar.It is a long, round-bodied fish with a dark green, grey, copper, brown, or black back and sides and a light underbelly. The fish also has typical features of primitive cypriniformes fishes, such as a homocercal tail, cycloid scales, as well as dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fin rays. When fullgrown, it can reach lengths between 12 and 20 inches long and weigh anywhere from 2 to 6 pounds. The fish's suckermouth with its fleshy lips are located in the inferior position at the bottom of its head, as the fish obtains its food from bottom surfaces.

They typically weigh less than 1 pound, with the world record being 1 pound 6 ounces. They are orange, green, yellow or blue in color, with speckles over their sides and back and a yellow-orange breast and belly. The coloration of the ctenoid scales of the pumpkinseed is one of the most vibrant of any freshwater fish and can range from an olive-green or brown to bright orange and blue. The sides are covered with vertical bars that are a faint green or blue, which are typically more prevalent in female pumpkinseeds. Orange spots may cover the dorsal, anal, and caudal fins and the cheeks have blue lines across them. The pumpkinseed is noted for the orange-red spot on the margin of its black gill cover. The pectoral fins of a pumpkinseed can be amber or clear, while the dorsal spines are black.

It is a food staple in African, Oceanic and Asian cultures and is believed to have been one of the earliest cultivated plants. Colocasia is thought to have originated in the Indo-Malayan region, perhaps in eastern India and Bangladesh, and spread eastward into Southeast Asia, eastern Asia, and the Pacific islands; westward to Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean; and then southward and westward from there into East Africa and West Africa, whence it spread to the Caribbean and Americas.

The great northern tilefish is a slow-growing and long-lived species, which has four stages of life. After hatching from eggs, the larvae will be found in plankton. As they grow into juveniles, the individuals will seek shelter until finding or making their own burrows. As adults, the tilefish will continue to expand its burrow in the sediment throughout its life. The diet of the larvae is unknown, but presumed to consist of zooplankton; juveniles and adults feed upon various benthic invertebrates, crustaceans and fish. After reaching sexual maturity between 5 and 7 years of age, females will lay eggs throughout the mating season for the male to fertilize, with each female laying an average of 2.3 million eggs.",168546.0,Lopholatilus_chamaeleonticeps,501.jpg,image/jpeg,129328.0,2012-04-20 09:30:02 UTC,528.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:45 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:31 UTC,,,False,specific,390349.0,True,,,,,,233.5,,,,666.0,,,,,42.5,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,108.0,,,,,52.0,,104.5,,,,315.0,20995.0,0.0,0.0,3500.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17.0,,,,98792.4571,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,65.8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,135.73600000000002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,2284.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20.004787,-8.434003,1
415,502,Mexican groundcherry,Physalis philadelphica var. immaculata,"The tomatillo (Physalis philadelphica) is a plant of the nightshade family, related to the cape gooseberry, bearing small, spherical and green or green-purple fruit of the same name. Tomatillos originated in Mexico,[1] and are a staple of that country's cuisine. Tomatillos are grown as annuals throughout the Western Hemisphere. Tomatillos are generally eaten fried, boiled or steamed.The tomatillo fruit is surrounded by an inedible, paper-like husk formed from the calyx. As the fruit matures, it fills the husk and can split it open by harvest. The husk turns brown, and the fruit can be several colors when ripe, including yellow, red, green, or even purple. Tomatillos are the key ingredient in fresh and cooked Mexican and Central-American green sauces. The freshness and greenness of the husk are quality criteria. Fruit should be firm and bright green, as the green color and tart flavor are the main culinary contributions of the fruit. Purple and red-ripening cultivars often have a slight sweetness, unlike the green- and yellow-ripening cultivars, and are therefore somewhat more suitable for fruit-like uses like jams and preserves. Like their close relatives cape gooseberries, tomatillos have a high pectin content. Another characteristic is they tend to have a varying degree of a sappy sticky coating, mostly when used on the green side out of the husk.",529632.0,Mexican_Groundcherry,502.jpg,image/jpeg,2962.0,2012-04-20 09:38:44 UTC,529.0,Vegetables,Fruit vegetables,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:45 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:31 UTC,,,False,specific,374021.0,True,,,,,,6.0,,,,152.0,,,,,402.0,16.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,82.5,960.0,1900.0,23207.5,2835.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,102.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1087.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1503.717,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,2.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,123.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,806.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,6.02,,0.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,160.3,,120.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,105.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,11.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-19.1475,-13.8113985,22

They are slender fish, with rounded scales and forked tails. Their mouths contain a single row of sharp teeth. Although the smallest species is just 13 centimetres long as an adult, most are much larger, and the largest can reach 2 metres . All salmonids spawn in fresh water, but in many cases, the fish spend most of their lives at sea, returning to the rivers only to reproduce. This life cycle is described as anadromous.

The body feathers are generally blackish and dark brown overall with a coppery sheen that becomes more complex in adult males. Adult males, called toms or gobblers, have a large, featherless, reddish head, red throat, and red wattles on the throat and neck. The head has fleshy growths called caruncles. Juvenile males are called jakes, the difference between an adult male and a juvenile is that the jake has a very short beard and his tail fan has longer feathers in the middle. The adult male's tail fan will be all the same length. When males are excited, a fleshy flap on the bill expands, and this, the wattles and the bare skin of the head and neck all become engorged with blood, almost concealing the eyes and bill. The long fleshy object over a male's beak is called a snood. When a male turkey is excited, its head turns blue; when ready to fight, it turns red.

419,506,"Cattle (Beef, Veal)",Bos taurus,"Cattle (colloquially cows) are the most common type of large domesticated ungulates. They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily Bovinae, are the most widespread species of the genus Bos, and are most commonly classified collectively as Bos primigenius. Cattle are raised as livestock for meat (beef and veal), as dairy animals for milk and other dairy products, and as draft animals (oxen or bullocks) (pulling carts, plows and the like).

420,507,Walleye,Sander vitreus,"Walleye (Sander vitreus, formerly Stizostedion vitreum) is a freshwater perciform fish native to most of Canada and to the northern United States. It is a North American close relative of the European pikeperch. The walleye is sometimes called the yellow walleye to distinguish it from the blue walleye, which is an extinct subspecies formerly found in the southern Great Lakes. In some parts of its range, the walleye is known as the Colored Pike, Yellow Pike or Pickerel (esp. in English-speaking Canada), although the fish is not related to other species of pikes which are members of the family Esocidae. Genetically, walleyes show a fair amount of variation across watersheds. In general, fish within a watershed are quite similar and are genetically distinct from those of nearby watersheds. The species has been artificially propagated for over a century and has been planted on top of existing populations or introduced into waters naturally devoid of the species, sometimes reducing the overall genetic distinctiveness of populations.",650173.0,Walleye,507.jpg,image/jpeg,62703.0,2012-04-20 09:44:19 UTC,534.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:45 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:31 UTC,,,False,specific,283036.0,True,,,,,,112.0,,,,223.5,,,,,29.5,16.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,66.0,,,,,0.0,,43.5,,,,274.75,21840.0,0.0,0.0,1390.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.239,,,,11380.243,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.034,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,83.0081,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9.063,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,147.0001,,,0.118,,,,,,,,,,,,,162.63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-30.066011,0.955364,1

425,514,Whitefish,Coregonus,"Coregonus is a diverse genus of fish in the salmon family (Salmonidae). The type species is Coregonus lavaretus. The Coregonus species are known as whitefishes. The genus contains at least 68 described extant taxa, but the true number of species is a matter of debate.Several species, including the Arctic cisco (C. autumnalis), the Bering cisco (C. laurettae), and the least cisco (C. sardinella) are anadromous, moving between salt water and fresh water.The genus was previously subdivided into two subgenera Coregonus (""true whitefishes"") and Leucichthys (""ciscoes""), Coregonus comprising taxa with sub-terminal mouth and usually a benthic feeding habit, Leucichthys those with terminal or supra-terminal mouth and usually a pelagic plankton-feeding habit. This classification is not natural however: based on molecular data, ciscoes comprise two distinct lineages within the genus. Moreover, the genus Stenodus is not phylogenetically distinct from Coregonus.Many whitefish species or ecotypes, especially from the Great Lakes and the Alpine lakes of Europe, have gone extinct over the past century or are endangered.

428,517,Tea leaf willow,Salix pulchra,"Salix pulchra is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, known by the common names diamondleaf willow, tealeaf willow, and thin red willow. It is native to northern North America, where it occurs in Alaska, Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. The species is also found in northern British Columbia, and occurs in Russia. This willow is an erect, deciduous shrub growing up to 4.6Œæm tall, but usually remaining smaller, especially in the Arctic and in alpine climates. Along with S. richardsonii and S. alaxensis, it is one of the tallest growing willows in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The species is dioecious, with male and female reproductive parts occurring on separate individuals. The inflorescence is a catkin. The catkins grow before the leaves appear in the spring. The leaves are green above and whitish underneath, and hairless. This plant is a dominant species on the tundra in many areas. It commonly grows with sedges. It may form thickets with other species of willow along waterways and on floodplains. It grows in spruce woodlands and muskegs. It grows above the timberline in interior Alaska, and at the timberline in northern Alaska. It often sprouts and grows after wildfire, and it persists in open habitat. This species was formerly known as S. planifolia subsp. pulchra, a subspecies of S. planifolia, but has since been treated as a distinct species. The two willow species have overlapping distribution and similar appearance, but can be distinguished by the longer stipules in S. pulchra. In areas where both willows occur, S. pulchra is often found at high elevations. S. pulchra and S. planifolia also form natural hybrids. S. pulchra is one of the least bitter-tasting willows in Alaska, and in the springtime, young leaves may be harvested for human consumption. The leaves and shoots were eaten by the Eskimo raw and dried, or stored in seal oil for future use. The leaves were also used to brew tea and make soup. At Nunivak Island, parts of this plant were chewed to treat ailments such as mouth sores and pain. This willow also provides a good source of vitamin C. Apart from medicinal purposes, Native Americans used parts of willows, including this species, in basket weaving, to make bows and arrows, and for building animal traps.",22488.0,Salix pulchra,517.jpg,image/jpeg,42818.0,2012-04-20 09:41:39 UTC,544.0,Herbs and Spices,Herbs,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:46 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:31 UTC,,,False,specific,669814.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,924.75,4350.0,,14400.0,31300.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,195.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,217.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-13.024746,-11.934945,14
429,518,Winged bean,Psophocarpus tetragonolobus,"The Winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus), also known as the Goa bean and Asparagus pea, Four-angled bean and Winged pea, is a tropical legume plant native to New Guinea. It grows abundantly in hot, humid equatorial countries, from the Philippines and Indonesia to India, Burma, Thailand and Sri Lanka. It does well in humid tropics with high rainfall. There are also varieties that can be grown in most areas of the U.S.. The winged bean plant grows as a vine with climbing stems and leaves, 3äóñ4 m in height. It is an herbaceous perennial, but can be grown as an annual. It is generally taller and notably larger than the Common bean. The bean pod is typically 15äóñ22Œæcm (6äóñ9Œæin) long and has four wings with frilly edges running lengthwise. The skin is waxy and the flesh partially translucent in the young pods. When the pod is fully ripe, it turns an ash-brown color and splits open to release the seeds. The large flower is a pale blue. The beans themselves are similar to soybeans in both use and nutritional content (being 29.8% to 39% protein). The plant is one of the best nitrogen fixers with nodulation accomplished by the soil bacterium Rhizobium. Because of its ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, the plant requires very little or no fertilizers. Being a tropical plant, it is sensitive to frost. Most plants will not flower if the day length is more than 12 hours, meaning they will not produce pods in most temperate zones, although day length neutral cultivars do exist. The seeds have a hard coat and it helps to soak them before planting to hasten germination. The plant grows very quickly, reaching a length of four meters in a few weeks.",506265.0,Winged bean,518.jpg,image/jpeg,38758.0,2012-04-20 09:41:30 UTC,545.0,Pulses,Beans,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:46 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:31 UTC,,,False,specific,3891.0,True,,,,,,55.0,,,,1604.5,,,,,1143.0,83.0,,,303.0,,,,,,,,,,1.6666666666666667,,,,,,440.625,13512.5,,29267.883333333335,4682.891666666666,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1172.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,95217.5298,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,8.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,11682.8243,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.735999999999999,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,4096.67,26.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,175.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,470.002,,0.0,1596.003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0,,,,,,0.0,,358.52903,,,,,1119.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,46.0,,0.0,0.0,17.12557,-7.363985,17
430,519,Yam,Dioscorea,"Yam is the common name for some plant species in the genus Dioscorea (family Dioscoreaceae) that form edible tubers. These are perennial herbaceous vines cultivated for the consumption of their starchy tubers in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and Oceania. There are many cultivars of yam. Although some varieties of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) are also called yam in parts of the United States and Canada, it is not part of the family Dioscoreaceae; rather it is in the morning glory family Convolvulaceae.The true yam is a versatile vegetable. It can be barbecued, roasted, fried, grilled, boiled, baked, smoked and when grated it is processed into a dessert recipe. Yams are the staple crop of the Igbo people of Nigeria, in their language it is known as ji, and they commemorate it by having yam festivals known as Iri-ji or Iwa-Ji depending on the dialect.Yams are a primary agricultural and culturally important commodity in West Africa, where over 95 percent of the world's yam crop is harvested. Yams are still important for survival in these regions. Some varieties of these tubers can be stored up to six months without refrigeration, which makes them a valuable resource for the yearly period of food scarcity at the beginning of the wet season. Yam cultivars are also cropped in other humid tropical countries.Yam tubers can grow up to 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in length and weigh up to 70 kilograms (154 lb) and 3 to 6 inches high. The vegetable has a rough skin which is difficult to peel, but which softens after heating. The skins vary in color from dark brown to light pink. The majority of the vegetable is composed of a much softer substance known as the ""meat"". This substance ranges in color from white or yellow to purple or pink in mature yams.",43366.0,Yam_(vegetable),519.jpg,image/jpeg,74561.0,2012-04-20 09:29:58 UTC,546.0,Vegetables,Tubers,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:46 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:31 UTC,,,False,specific,4672.0,True,,,,,,0.0,,,,5.333333333333333,,,,,54.666666666666664,10.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,325.0,1503.3333333333333,4033.333333333333,42212.5,316.6666666666667,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,6480.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,151997.39992000005,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,51.025999999999996,426.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,3253.95296,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,5250.0,8.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,93.009,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,15.008,,0.0,654.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,119.0,,,,,,972.515,,5522.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,922.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,23.085035,-1.5789813,22

Several species of jicama occur, but the one found in [many] markets is Pachyrrizus erosus. The two cultivated forms of P. erosus are jicama de agua and jicama de leche.

Furthermore, Greenland cod (G. ogac) is no longer considered a distinct species but rather a subspecies of Pacific cod (G. macrocephalus).",164710.0,Gadus,526.jpg,image/jpeg,196359.0,2012-04-20 09:29:55 UTC,553.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:46 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:31 UTC,,,False,specific,8048.0,True,,,,,,8309.0,,,,20653.0,,,,,935.0,935.0,,935.0,10422.0,,,,,935.0,,,,,7328.0,,935.0,,24.0,165.78571428571428,1246.25,0.0,17.857142857142858,883.3333333333334,60960.71428571429,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,124260.06,,,,1674226.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,54150.00034,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1623873.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,488500.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,187102.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,47200.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37210.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,260771.09,,,117470.9,,,,,,,,,,,253370.0,,178090.0015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,104270.0,,,,34.562458,31.237288,1

They are demersal fish living on or near sand, gravel or clay bottoms at depths of between 50 and 2,000 m (and ft). The halibut is among the largest teleost (bony) fish in the world. Halibut are strong swimmers and are able to migrate long distances. Halibut size is not age-specific, but rather tends to follow a cycle related to halibut (and therefore food) abundance. The native habitat of the Atlantic halibut is the temperate waters of the northern Atlantic, from Labrador and Greenland to Iceland, the Barents Sea and as far south as the Bay of Biscay. It is the largest flatfish in the Atlantic and one of the largest species of flatfish in the world, reaching lengths of up to 4.7Œæm and weights of 320Œækg .

They are also known as freshwater smelts or typical smelts to distinguish them from the related Argentinidae, Bathylagidae, and Retropinnidae.Some smelt species are common in the North American Great Lakes, and in the lakes and seas of the northern part of Europe, where they run in large shoals along the saltwater coastline during spring migration to their spawning streams.In size, smelts usually grow to about 20 cm (7.9 in) long, although some species can reach 70 cm (28 in). Smelts are a food source for salmon and lake trout.Like salmon, many species are anadromous, living most of their lives in the sea, but traveling into fresh water to breed.

Previously, more species, with disjunct distributions, were named as members of this genus Macadamia. Genetics and morphological studies more recently published in 2008 by Austin Mast and colleagues show they have separated from this genus Macadamia, correlating less closely than thought from earlier morphological studies.Macadamia species grow as small to large evergreen trees 2?12 m (6.6?39.4 ft) tall. The leaves are arranged in whorls of three to six, lanceolate to obovate or elliptical in shape, 6?30 cm long and 2?13 cm broad, with an entire or spiny-serrated margin. The flowers are produced in a long, slender, simple raceme 5?30 cm long, the individual flowers 10?15 mm long, white to pink or purple, with four tepals.

The goat is a member of the family Bovidae and is closely related to the sheep as both are in the goat-antelope subfamily Caprinae. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat. Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species, and have been used for their milk, meat, hair, and skins over much of the world. In 2011, there were more than 924 million live goats around the globe, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.Female goats are referred to as ""does"" or ""nannies"", intact males as ""bucks"" or ""billies"", and their offspring are ""kids"". Castrated males are ""wethers"".

451,544,"Bivalvia (Clam, Mussel, Oyster)",Bivalvia,"Bivalvia is a class of marine and freshwater molluscs that have laterally compressed bodies enclosed by a shell consisting of two hinged parts. They have no head, and they also lack a radula. Bivalves include clams, oysters, cockles, mussels, scallops, and numerous other families that live in saltwater, and well as a number of families that live in freshwater. The majority are filter feeders. The gills have evolved into ctenidia, specialised organs for feeding and breathing. Most bivalves bury themselves in sediment, where they are relatively safe from predation. Others lie on the sea floor or attach themselves to rocks or other hard surfaces. A few bore into wood, clay or stone and live inside these substances. Some bivalves, such as the scallops, can swim.The shell of a bivalve is composed of calcium carbonate, and consists of two, usually similar, parts called valves. These are joined together along one edge (the hinge line) by a flexible ligament that, usually in conjunction with interlocking ""teeth"" on each of the valves, forms the hinge. This arrangement allows the shell to be opened and closed without the two halves becoming disarticulated. The shell is typically bilaterally symmetrical, with the hinge lying in the sagittal plane. Adult shell sizes of bivalves vary from fractions of a millimetre to over a metre in length, but the majority of species do not exceed 10 cm (4 in).",79118.0,Bivalvia,544.jpg,image/jpeg,8368.0,2012-04-20 09:42:42 UTC,571.0,Aquatic foods,Mollusks,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:47 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:32 UTC,,,False,specific,6544.0,True,,0.0,0.0,12.0,8.0,38.333333333333336,45.0,54.0,6.0,1523.1666666666667,14.0,,1.0,,839.8333333333334,60.666666666666664,,23.666666666666668,21.333333333333332,5.5,0.0,1.0,1.0,37.5,,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.5,6.5,37.0,0.0,,,465.1875,13506.25,0.0,12386.25,8013.75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,57270.235,,,,135494.3477,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,57771.928,11.401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,78019.82710000001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,567.042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,134.12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,91450.014,,,38826.014,,,,,,,,,,,6276.122,,69.276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,15.90126,2.56089,1

453,546,Shrimp,Caridea,"The term shrimp is used to refer to some decapod crustaceans, although the exact animals covered can vary. Used broadly, it may cover any of the groups with elongated bodies and a primarily swimming mode of locomotion äóñ chiefly Caridea and Dendrobranchiata. In some fields, however, the term is used more narrowly, and may be restricted to Caridea, to smaller species of either group, or to only the marine species. Under the broader definition, shrimp may be synonymous with prawn, covering stalk-eyed swimming crustaceans with long narrow muscular tails, long whiskers and slender legs. They swim forwards by paddling with swimmerets on the underside of their abdomens. Crabs and lobsters have strong walking legs, whereas shrimp have thin fragile legs which they use primarily for perching. Shrimp are widespread and abundant. They can be found feeding near the seafloor on most coasts and estuaries, as well as in rivers and lakes. To escape predators, some species flip off the seafloor and dive into the sediment. They usually live from one to seven years. Shrimp are often solitary, though they can form large schools during the spawning season. There are thousands of species, and usually there is a species adapted to any particular habitat. Any small crustacean which resembles a shrimp tends to be called one. They play important roles in the food chain and are important food sources for larger animals from fish to whales. The muscular tails of shrimp can be delicious to eat, and they are widely caught and farmed for human consumption. Commercial shrimp species support an industry worth 50 billion dollars a year, and in 2010 the total commercial production of shrimp was nearly 7 million tonnes (see production chart on the right). Shrimp farming took off during the 1980s, particularly in China, and by 2007 the harvest from shrimp farms exceeded the capture of wild shrimp. There are significant issues with excessive bycatch when shrimp are captured in the wild, and with pollution damage done to estuaries when they are used to support shrimp farming. Many shrimp species are small as the term shrimp suggests, about 2Œæcm long, but some shrimp exceed 25Œæcm . Larger shrimp are more likely to be targeted commercially, and are often referred to as prawns, particularly in Britain.",96106.0,Shrimp,546.jpg,image/jpeg,82963.0,2012-04-20 09:36:22 UTC,573.0,Aquatic foods,Crustaceans,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:47 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:32 UTC,,,False,specific,6694.0,True,,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,27.285714285714285,2.142857142857143,33.8,14.333333333333334,4064.0,631.8571428571429,3691.6,18.571428571428573,,103.42857142857143,,4601.9,504.5,,1.5555555555555556,68.4,10.666666666666666,1.4285714285714286,1.7142857142857142,3.888888888888889,26.5,,40.888888888888886,2.4285714285714284,0.0,4.5,6.875,11.8,4.0,0.0,0.0,569.8695652173913,15029.0,315.0,5064.333333333333,6854.666666666667,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6792.0,,,,295595.22579999996,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1068.9934999999998,82.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40247.14970000001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,152974.29700000002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4773.0692,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2002.185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,381.20090000000005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7128.0,,,6304.081,,,,,,,,,,,97694.0982,,6718.365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,61.0211,,,,,,,,,442.0,,,,27.319542,9.410031,1

460,553,Yardlong bean,Vigna unguiculata ssp. sesquipedalis,"Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis is a legume cultivated to be eaten as green pods. It is known as the yardlong bean, bora, long-podded cowpea, asparagus bean, snake bean, or Chinese long bean. Despite common name, the pods are actually only about half a yard long; the subspecies name sesquipedalis (one-and-a-half-foot-long) is a rather exact approximation of the pods' length. This plant is of a different genus than the common bean. It is a vigorous climbing annual vine. The plant is subtropical/tropical and most widely grown in the warmer parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and southern China. A variety of the cowpea, it is grown primarily for its strikingly long (35-75 cm) immature pods and has uses very similar to that of the green bean. The many varieties of yardlong beans are usually distinguished by the different colors of their mature seeds. The pods, which can begin to form just 60 days after sowing, hang in groups of two or more. They are best for vegetable use if picked before they reach full maturity; however, overlooked pods can be used like dry beans in soups. When harvesting, it is important not to pick the buds which are above the beans; since the plant will set many more beans on the same stem. The plants take longer to reach maturity than bush beans, but once producing, the beans are quick-growing and daily checking/harvesting is often a necessity. The plants will produce beans until frost.",524853.0,Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis,553.jpg,image/jpeg,158407.0,2012-04-20 09:32:27 UTC,580.0,Pulses,Peas,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:48 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:32 UTC,,,False,specific,138955.0,True,,,,,,0.3333333333333333,,,,37.166666666666664,,,,,110.33333333333333,89.66666666666667,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.333333333333333,,,,,,312.8333333333333,8128.333333333333,6200.0,36722.14166666666,1038.2666666666667,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,84979.02100000001,0.0,0.0,0.0,177503.75923999998,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.825,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,1758.6819999999998,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,12869.649790000001,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1346.91225,29.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,1162.2973,,0.0,1375.0690000000002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,87.0,,,,,,0.0,,14700.990000000002,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,24.463795,-1.582909,17
461,554,Great horned owl,Bubo virginianus,"The great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), also known as the tiger owl, is a large owl native to the Americas. It is an adaptable bird with a vast range and is the most widely distributed true owl in the Americas.The great horned owl is the heaviest extant owl in Central and South America and is the second heaviest owl in North America, after the closely related but very different looking snowy owl (B. scandiacus). It ranges in length from 43?64 cm (17?25 in) and has a wingspan of 91?153 cm (36?60 in). Females are invariably somewhat larger than males. An average adult is around 55 cm (22 in) long with a 124 cm (49 in) wingspan and weighing about 1.4 kg (3.1 lb). Depending on subspecies, the great horned owl can weigh from 0.6 to 2.6 kg (1.3 to 5.7 lb). Among standard measurements, the tail measures 17.5?25 cm (6.9?9.8 in) long, the wing chord measures 31.3?40 cm (12.3?15.7 in), the tarsal length is 5.4?8 cm (2.1?3.1 in) and the bill is 3.3?5.2 cm (1.3?2.0 in).",177884.0,Great_horned_owl,554.jpg,image/jpeg,126118.0,2012-04-20 09:37:38 UTC,581.0,Animal foods,Poultry,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:48 UTC,2017-06-08 01:36:16 UTC,,,False,specific,56268.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,352.0,22700.0,,0.0,5000.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,312.5,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,8.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,77.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-30.08533,-2.134148,0

Bearss, who developed this seedless variety about 1895 in his nursery at Porterville, California), is a citrus fruit related to the standard lime. It has a nearly thornless tree. The Persian lime is of hybrid origin, most likely from a cross between key lime (Citrus aurantiifolia) and either lemon (Citrus í„limon) or citron (Citrus medica).It has a uniquely fragrant, spicy aroma. The fruit is about 6 centimetres (2.4 in) in diameter, often with slightly nippled ends, and is usually sold while green, although it yellows as it reaches full ripeness. It is also widely available dried, as it is often used this way in Persian cooking. It is larger, thicker-skinned, with less intense citrus aromatics than the key lime (Citrus aurantifolia).

467,560,Jew's ear,Auricularia auricula-judae,"Auricularia auricula-judae, known as the Jew's ear, wood ear, jelly ear or by a number of other common names, is a species of edible Auriculariales fungus found worldwide. The fruiting body is distinguished by its noticeably ear-like shape and brown colouration; it grows upon wood, especially elder. Its specific epithet is derived from the belief that Judas Iscariot hanged himself from an elder tree; the common name ""Judas's ear"" eventually became ""Jew's ear"", while today ""jelly ear"" and other names are sometimes used. The fungus can be found throughout the year in temperate regions worldwide, where it grows upon both dead and living wood.The fruit body of A. auricula-judae is normally 3 to 8 centimetres (1.2 to 3.1 in) across, but can be as much as 12 centimetres (4.7 in). It is distinctively shaped, typically being reminiscent of a floppy ear, though the fruit bodies can also be cup-shaped. It is normally attached to the substrate laterally and sometimes by a very short stalk. The species has a tough, gelatinous, elastic texture when fresh, but it dries hard and brittle. The outer surface is a bright reddish-tan-brown with a purplish hint, often covered in tiny, downy hairs of a grey colour. It can be smooth, as is typical of younger specimens, or undulating with folds and wrinkles. The colour becomes darker with age. The inner surface is a lighter grey-brown in colour and smooth. It is sometimes wrinkled, again with folds and wrinkles, and may have ""veins"", making it appear even more ear-like.",,Jew%27s_ear,560.jpg,image/jpeg,97463.0,2012-04-20 09:30:55 UTC,587.0,Vegetables,Mushrooms,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:48 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:32 UTC,,,False,specific,29892.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,419.0,2650.0,,43890.0,240.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,5291.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2696.54,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,126.75,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,111.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,1603.0,,0.0,1110.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,1865.009,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-18.63739,-20.99538,22

474,567,Oyster mushroom,Pleurotus ostreatus,"Pleurotus is a genus of gilled mushrooms which includes one of the most widely eaten mushrooms, P. ostreatus. Species of Pleurotus may be called oyster, abalone, or tree mushrooms, and are some of the most commonly cultivated edible mushrooms in the world. Pleurotus fungi have been used in mycoremediation of pollutants such as petroleum and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.The caps may be laterally attached (with no stem). If there is a stem, it is normally eccentric and the gills are decurrent along it. The term pleurotoid is used for mushrooms having this general shape.The spores are smooth and elongated (described as ""cylindrical""). Where hyphae meet, they are joined by clamp connections. Pleurotus is not considered to be a bracket fungus, and most of the species are monomitic (with a soft consistency). However, remarkably, Pleurotus dryinus can sometimes be dimitic, meaning that it has additional skeletal hyphae, which give it a tougher consistency like bracket fungi.",,Oyster_mushroom,567.jpg,image/jpeg,67570.0,2012-04-20 09:40:11 UTC,594.0,Vegetables,Mushrooms,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:48 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:32 UTC,,,False,specific,5322.0,True,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,31.0,,,,,123.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,86.0,3310.0,2300.0,6090.0,410.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1200.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3035.34756,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0011,80.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,671.0,,0.0,,7372.02436,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,1110.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.796,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,1250.0,6602.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,480.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,35500.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,1224.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,58.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,10.0,,0.0,0.0,-20.839027,0.57602245,22

476,569,Maitake,Grifola frondosa,"Grifola frondosa is a polypore mushroom that grows in clusters at the base of trees, particularly oaks. The mushroom is commonly known among English speakers as hen-of-the-woods, ram's head and sheep's head. In the United States' supplement market, as well as in Asian grocery stores, the mushroom is known by its Japanese name maitake, which means ""dancing mushroom"". Throughout Italian American communities in the northeastern United States, it is commonly known as the signorina mushroom. G. frondosa should not be confused with Laetiporus sulphureus, another edible bracket fungus that is commonly called chicken of the woods or ""sulphur shelf"". The fungus becomes inedible like all polypores when they are older, because it is too tough to eat.G. frondosa grows from an underground tuber-like structure known as a sclerotium, about the size of a potato. The fruiting body, occurring as large as 100 cm, is a cluster consisting of multiple grayish-brown caps which are often curled or spoon-shaped, with wavy margins and 2?7 cm broad. The undersurface of each cap bears approximately one to three pores per millimeter, with the tubes rarely deeper than 3 mm. The milky-white stipe (stalk) has a branchy structure and becomes tough as the mushroom matures.In Japan, the Maitake can grow to more than 50 pounds (20 kilograms), earning this giant mushroom the title ""King of Mushrooms"". Maitake is one of the major culinary mushrooms used in Japan, the others being shiitake, shimeji and enoki. They are used in a wide variety of dishes, often being a key ingredient in nabemono or cooked in foil with butter.",,Maitake,569.jpg,image/jpeg,67650.0,2012-04-20 09:42:40 UTC,596.0,Vegetables,Mushrooms,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:49 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:32 UTC,,,False,specific,5627.0,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,30.0,,,,,90.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,80.5,1940.0,2700.0,6970.0,190.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,742.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2670.9972000000002,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,4320.0,,0.0,,5937.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,6.441,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,2.189,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0001,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,15.29,,0.0,0.386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,2616.404,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,55870.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,753.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,2500.6,,0.0,0.0,-18.091206,-4.458026,22
477,570,Ostrich fern,Matteuccia struthiopteris,"Matteuccia struthiopteris (common names ostrich fern or shuttlecock fern) is a crown-forming, colony-forming fern, occurring in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in eastern and northern Europe, northern Asia and northern North America. The species epithet struthiopteris comes from Ancient Greek words, struthio meaning ostrich and pterion meaning wing.It grows from a completely vertical crown, favoring riverbanks and sandbars, but sends out lateral stolons to form new crowns. It thus can form dense colonies resistant to destruction by floodwaters.The fronds are dimorphic, with the deciduous green sterile fronds being almost vertical, 100?170 cm (39?67 in) tall and 20?35 cm (7.9?13.8 in) broad, long-tapering to the base but short-tapering to the tip, so that they resemble ostrich plumes, hence the name. The fertile fronds are shorter, 40?60 cm (16?24 in) long, brown when ripe, with highly modified and constricted leaf tissue curled over the sporangia; they develop in autumn, persist erect over the winter and release the spores in early spring.Matteuccia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Sthenopis auratus.",17596.0,Ostrich_fern,570.jpg,image/jpeg,84015.0,2012-04-23 10:43:12 UTC,597.0,Vegetables,Leaf vegetables,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:49 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:32 UTC,,2.0,False,specific,3277.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,88.25,4430.0,,5640.0,375.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,343.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,588.0036,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,4480.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,167.68,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,587.8132,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,34.728500000000004,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-22.061798,-6.238378,22

481,574,Atlantic menhaden,Brevoortia tyrannus,"The Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) is a silvery, highly compressed fish in the herring family, Clupeidae. A filter feeder, it lives on plankton caught in midwater. Adult fish can filter up to four gallons of water a minute; and they play an important role in clarifying ocean water. They are also a natural check to the deadly red tide. Menhaden have historically been used as a fertilizer for crops. It is likely that menhaden is the fish that Squanto taught the Pilgrims to bury alongside freshly planted seeds as fertilizer. Other uses for menhaden include: feed for animals, bait for fish, oil for human consumption, oil for manufacturing purposes and oil as a fuel source. While many articles today state the menhaden as being inedible, the fish were once consumed as sardines or fried in early American history. Maine fisherman, for example, would eat fried pogies for breakfast. The fish that were not sold for bait would be sold to poorer classes for food. Menhaden historically occurred in large numbers in the North Atlantic, ranging from Nova Scotia, Canada to central Florida, USA, although their presence in northern waters has diminished in the 20th Century. They swim in large schools, some reportedly up to 40 miles long. As a result of their abundance they are important prey for a wide range of predators including bluefish, striped bass, cod, haddock, halibut, mackerel, swordfish, and tuna.",161732.0,Atlantic menhaden,574.jpg,image/jpeg,112732.0,2012-04-20 09:33:41 UTC,601.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:49 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:32 UTC,,,False,specific,224708.0,True,,,,,,10482.0,,,,14527.0,,,,,2154.0,1490.0,,2739.0,1332.0,,,,,1169.0,,,,,352.0,,4915.0,,,,2338.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1102.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2500.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,73000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400.0,,,1376.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1580.26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-5.103531,-10.222248,1
482,575,Wheat,Triticum,"Wheat (Triticum spp. ) is a cereal grain, originally from the Levant region of the Near East and Ethiopian Highlands, but now cultivated worldwide. In 2010, world production of wheat was 651 million tons, making it the third most-produced cereal after maize (844 million tons) and rice (672 million tons). Wheat was the second most-produced cereal in 2009; world production in that year was 682 million tons, after maize (817 million tons), and with rice as a close third (679 million tons). This grain is grown on more land area than any other commercial food. World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined. Globally, wheat is the leading source of vegetable protein in human food, having a higher protein content than soybeans or the other major cereals, maize (corn) or rice. In terms of total production tonnages used for food, it is currently second to rice as the main human food crop and ahead of maize, after allowing for maize's more extensive use in animal feeds. Wheat was a key factor enabling the emergence of city-based societies at the start of civilization because it was one of the first crops that could be easily cultivated on a large scale, and had the additional advantage of yielding a harvest that provides long-term storage of food. Wheat contributed to the emergence of city-states in the Fertile Crescent, including the Babylonian and Assyrian empires. Wheat grain is a staple food used to make flour for leavened, flat and steamed breads, biscuits, cookies, cakes, breakfast cereal, pasta, noodles, couscous and for fermentation to make beer, other alcoholic beverages, or biofuel. Wheat is planted to a limited extent as a forage crop for livestock, and its straw can be used as a construction material for roofing thatch. The whole grain can be milled to leave just the endosperm for white flour. The by-products of this are bran and germ. The whole grain is a concentrated source of vitamins, minerals, and protein, while the refined grain is mostly starch.",42236.0,Wheat,575.jpg,image/jpeg,751715.0,2012-04-20 09:37:55 UTC,602.0,Cereals and cereal products,Cereals,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:49 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:32 UTC,,,True,specific,4564.0,True,,0.0,0.0,,,33.4,0.0,,,921.0,,,,,2977.0384615384614,324.38461538461536,,0.0,0.43478260869565216,0.0,,,0.0,0.21739130434782608,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.333333333333334,0.0,1069.2063492063492,11120.37037037037,7707.111111111111,61444.074074074066,10389.25925925926,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,13934.004400000002,0.0,0.0,0.0,440630.9115,,0.0,0.0,,,,,154.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.19,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,27386.021,11698.103000000001,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,5463.42,,0.0,,541917.5653499997,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.654,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,15585.733999999999,,,,,,,,0.453,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,162.0,,0.0,0.0,68504.23329999999,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,104085.73470000002,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,135.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,162256.9791,361.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,2161.6322099999998,,0.0,6684.886380000001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,195060.8937,,103350.141044,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.027,,,,,0.0,,,308.0,,,,0.0,,,8907.762999999999,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,27.268318,22.899582,5

484,577,Agave,Agave,"Agave is a genus of monocots. The plants are perennial, but each rosette flowers once and then dies. Some species are known by the name century plant.In the APG III system, the genus is placed in the subfamily Agavoideae of the broadly circumscribed family Asparagaceae. Some authors prefer to place it in the segregate family Agavaceae. Traditionally, it was circumscribed to be composed of about 166 species, but it is now usually understood to have about 208 species.Chiefly Mexican, agaves are also native to the southern and western United States and central and tropical South America. They are succulents with a large rosette of thick, fleshy leaves, each ending generally in a sharp point and with a spiny margin; the stout stem is usually short, the leaves apparently springing from the root. Along with plants from the related genus Yucca, various Agave species are popular ornamental plants.Each rosette is monocarpic and grows slowly to flower only once. During flowering, a tall stem or ""mast"" grows from the center of the leaf rosette and bears a large number of short, tubular flowers. After development of fruit, the original plant dies, but suckers are frequently produced from the base of the stem, which become new plants.",182659.0,Agave,577.jpg,image/jpeg,195698.0,2012-04-20 09:41:03 UTC,604.0,Vegetables,Other vegetables,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:49 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:32 UTC,,,False,specific,39509.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,470.0,1073.3333333333333,10933.333333333334,43403.333333333336,376.6666666666667,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,51.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,97254.31807999998,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,364.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,3.292,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,58.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,1251.4187000000002,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.199,33.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,16.078700000000005,20000.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,701.001,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,24.24,,0.0,202.0023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,94331.46220000001,,28.869199999999996,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.01011,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,25.877953,-10.704448,22
485,578,Narrowleaf cattail,Typha angustifolia,"Typha angustifolia L., (also lesser bulrush or narrowleaf cattail or lesser reedmace), is a perennial herbaceous plant of genus Typha.

The plant's leaves are flat, very narrow (Œ_""-Œ_"" wide), and 3'-6' tall when mature; 12-16 leaves arise from each vegetative shoot. At maturity, they have distinctive stalks that are about as tall as the leaves; the stalks are topped with brown, fluffy, sausage-shaped flowering heads. The plants have sturdy, rhizomatous roots that can extend 27"" and are typically Œ_""-1Œ_"" in diameter.It has been proposed that the species was introduced from Europe to North America. In North America, it is also thought to have been introduced from coastal to inland locations.Several parts of the plant are edible, including during various seasons the dormant sprouts on roots and bases of leaves, the inner core of the stalk, green bloom spikes, ripe pollen, and starchy roots.

491,584,Sturgeon,Acipenseridae,"Sturgeon is the common name used for some 26 species of fish in the family Acipenseridae, including the genera Acipenser, Huso, Scaphirhynchus and Pseudoscaphirhynchus. The term includes over 20 species commonly referred to as sturgeon and several closely related species that have distinct common names, notably sterlet, kaluga and beluga. Collectively, the family is also known as the true sturgeons. Sturgeon is sometimes used more exclusively to refer to the species in the two best-known genera, Acipenser and Huso. One of the oldest families of bony fish in existence, sturgeon are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. They are distinctive for their elongated bodies, lack of scales, and occasional great size: sturgeons ranging from 7äóñ12 feet (2-3Œ_ m) in length are common, and some species grow up to 18 feet . Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders, spawning upstream and feeding in river deltas and estuaries. While some are entirely freshwater, very few venture into the open ocean beyond near coastal areas. Several species of sturgeons are harvested for their roe, which is made into caviar äóî a luxury food which makes some sturgeons pound for pound the most valuable of all harvested fish. Because they are slow-growing and mature very late in life, they are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and to other threats, including pollution and habitat fragmentation. Most species of sturgeons are currently considered to be at risk of extinction, making them more critically endangered than any other group of species.",161064.0,Sturgeon,584.jpg,image/jpeg,7266.0,2012-04-20 09:30:47 UTC,611.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:49 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:32 UTC,,,False,specific,7900.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,49.0,607.0,6400.0,0.0,3250.0,9850.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25300.0,,,,14200.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,44050.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,96800.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11240.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,900.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3450.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,87400.0,,,56500.0,,,,,,,,,,,11610.0,,11420.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12370.0,,,,4.5721974,9.608886,1

The lake trout is prized both as a game fish and as a food fish.Lake trout are the largest of the charrs; the record weighed almost 46.3 kilograms (102 lb) (netted) with a length of 50 inches (127 cm), and 15? to 40-pound fish are not uncommon. The average length is 24-36 inches (61?92 cm). The largest caught on a rod and reel according to the IGFA was 72 pounds (33 kg), caught in Great Bear Lake in 1995 with a length of 59 inches (150 cm).",162002.0,Lake_trout,596.jpg,image/jpeg,69417.0,2012-04-20 09:36:59 UTC,623.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:50 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:33 UTC,,,False,specific,8040.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,613.0,11100.0,0.0,0.0,7800.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,110.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,226.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7687.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1873.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,528.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,210.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,242.0,,,97.0,,,,,,,,,,,750.0,,1040.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80.0,,,,-24.952461,-0.87782186,1

Three of their five pairs of legs have claws, including the first pair, which are usually much larger than the others. Highly prized as seafood, lobsters are economically important, and are often one of the most profitable commodities in coastal areas they populate. Commercially important species include two species of Homarus from the northern Atlantic Ocean, and scampi ? the northern-hemisphere genus Nephrops and the southern-hemisphere genus Metanephrops.

The family consists of 51 species in 15 genera and two subfamilies. All species are in the subfamily Scombrinae, except the butterfly kingfish - which is the sole member of subfamily Gasterochismatinae. Scombrids have two dorsal fins, and a series of finlets behind the rear dorsal fin and anal fin. The caudal fin is strongly divided and rigid, with a slender, ridged, base. The first (spiny) dorsal fin and the pelvic fins are normally retracted into body grooves. Species lengths vary from the 20Œæcm of the island mackerel to the 4.58Œæm recorded for the immense Atlantic bluefin tuna. Scombrids are generally predators of the open ocean, and are found worldwide in tropical and temperate waters. They are capable of considerable speed, due to a highly streamlined body and retractable fins. Some members of the family, in particular the tunas, are notable for being partially endothermic (warm-blooded), a feature that also helps them to maintain high speed and activity. Other adaptations include a large amount of red muscle, allowing them to maintain activity over long periods. Two of the fastest recorded scombrids are the wahoo and the yellowfin tuna, which can each attain speeds of 75Œækm/h .",172398.0,Scombridae,600.jpg,image/jpeg,69172.0,2012-04-20 09:33:21 UTC,627.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:50 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:33 UTC,,,False,specific,8224.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,178.0,1049.5,10325.0,50.0,100.0,20150.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,342.0,,,,15065.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,109.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,71571.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5430.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5303.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,463.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1892.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,931.0,,,50.0,,,,,,,,,,,2145.0,,1502.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,737.0,,,,-4.9118767,11.356112,1

513,606,True oyster,Ostreidae,"The Ostreidae, the true oysters, include most species of molluscs commonly consumed as oysters. Pearl oysters are not true oysters, and belong to the suborder Pterioida. Like scallops, true oysters have a central adductor muscle, which means the shell has a characteristic central scar marking its point of attachment. The shell tends to be irregular as a result of attaching to a substrate. Both oviparous (egg-bearing) and larviparous (larvae-bearing) species are known within Ostreidae. Both types are hermaphrodites. However, the larviparous species show a pattern of alternating sex within each individual, whereas the oviparous species are simultaneous hermaphrodites, producing either female or male gametes according to circumstances. Members of genus Ostrea generally live continually immersed and are quite flat, with roundish shells. They differ from most bivalves by having shells completely made up of calcite, but with internal muscle scars of aragonitic composition. They fare best in somewhat oligotrophic water. They brood their fertilized eggs for various proportions of the period from fertilization to hatching. Members of genera Saccostrea and Crassostrea generally live in the intertidal zone, broadcast sperm and eggs into the sea, and can thrive in eutrophic water.

The smaller species eat sea-floor invertebrates such as polychaetes and crustaceans, but the larger righteye flounders, such as H. hippoglossus, which grows up to 4.7 metres (15 ft) in length, feed on other fishes and cephalopods as well.They include many important commercially fished species, including not only the various fish called flounders, but also the European plaice, the halibuts, the lemon sole, the common dab, the Pacific Dover sole, and the flukes.",172859.0,Pleuronectidae,610.jpg,image/jpeg,83803.0,2012-04-20 09:38:11 UTC,637.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:51 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:33 UTC,,,False,specific,8256.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,666.0,8750.0,666.6666666666666,12633.333333333332,5266.666666666667,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1521.0,,,,2414.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,66.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5418.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1644.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,59.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,211.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,112.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,960.0,,,49.0,,,,,,,,,,,288.0,,179.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37.0,,,,-17.90296,-10.256841,1

Fresh water species are found in Africa, southern Asia, New Guinea and Australia.In the past soles of the Americas (both fresh and salt water) were included in this family, but they have been separated to their own family, the American soles (Achiridae). The only true sole remaining in that region is Aseraggodes herrei of the Galíçpagos and Cocos Island.The true soles are bottom-dwelling fishes feeding on small crustaceans and other invertebrates. The family contains 30 genera and a total of about 180 species.Soles begin life as bilaterally symmetric larvae, with an eye on each side of the head. But during development the left eye moves around onto the right side of the head. Adult soles lie on their left (blind) side on the sea floor, often covered in mud which, in combination with their dark colours, makes them hard to spot.A flatfish resembling a small halibut or sole was observed by the Bathyscaphe Trieste at the bottom of the Mariana Trench at a depth of about 11 km (36,000 ft).

There are armour-plated types and also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbels; members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food.

The word Thunnus is the Middle Latin form of the Ancient Greek: ?????? (thí_nnos) ?tunny-fish? ? which is in turn derived from ???? (thyn?), ""to rush; to dart"". The first written use of the word was by Homer.Their coloring, metallic blue on top and shimmering silver-white on the bottom, helps camouflage them from above and below. They can grow to 15 feet long and weigh over 1,000 pounds, and can swim up to 50 miles per hour when pursuing prey. Atlantic bluefin tunas are warm-blooded, which is a rare trait among fish, and are comfortable in the cold waters. Bluefin fish are found in Newfoundland and Iceland, as well as the tropical waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea, where they go each year to spawn.",172418.0,Thunnus,621.jpg,image/jpeg,10351.0,2012-04-20 09:33:32 UTC,649.0,Aquatic foods,Fishes,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:52 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:33 UTC,,,False,specific,8234.0,True,,,,,,52.6,,,,1738.4,,,,,1821.2,96.4,,8.666666666666666,18.0,,,,,22.666666666666668,,,,,19.333333333333332,,6.0,,8.25,0.0,469.57142857142856,25064.0,0.0,710.6666666666666,5169.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.009,,,,187758.06939999998,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,343.111,0.018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,532.039,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,92.631,,,53.0261,,,,,,,,,,,163624.31,,38514.035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,26.362728,-7.084842,1
528,622,Walnut,Juglans,"A walnut is an edible seed of any tree of the genus Juglans, especially the Persian or English walnut, Juglans regia. Broken nutmeats of the eastern black walnut from the tree Juglans nigra are also commercially available in small quantities, as are foods prepared with butternut nutmeats from Juglans cinerea. Walnut seeds are a high density source of nutrients, particularly proteins and essential fatty acids. Walnuts, like other tree nuts, must be processed and stored properly. Poor storage makes walnuts susceptible to insect and fungal mold infestations; the latter produces aflatoxinäóîa potent carcinogen. A mold infested walnut seed batch should not be screened and then consumed; the entire batch should be discarded. Walnuts are rounded, single-seeded stone fruits of the walnut tree. The walnut fruit is enclosed in a green, leathery, fleshy husk. This husk is inedible. After harvest, the removal of the husk reveals the wrinkly walnut shell, which is in two halves. This shell is hard and encloses the kernel, which is also made up of two halves separated by a partition. The seed kernels äóî commonly available as shelled walnuts äóî are enclosed in a brown seed coat which contains antioxidants. The antioxidants protect the oil-rich seed from atmospheric oxygen thereby preventing rancidity. The two most common major species of walnuts are grown for their seeds äóî the Persian or English Walnut and the Black Walnut. The English Walnut (J. regia) originated in Persia, and the Black Walnut (J. nigra) is native to eastern North America. The Black walnut is of high flavor, but due to its hard shell and poor hulling characteristics it is not grown commercially for nut production. The commercially produced walnut varieties are nearly all hybrids of the English walnut. Other species include J. californica, the California Black Walnut (often used as a root stock for commercial breeding of J. regia), J. cinerea (butternuts), and J. major, the Arizona Walnut. Walnuts are late to bear leaves, typically not until more than halfway through the spring. They also secrete chemicals into the soil to prevent competing vegetation from growing. Because of this, flowers or vegetable gardens should not be planted too close to them. The husks of walnut contains a juice that will readily stain anything it comes into contact with. It has been used as a dye for cloth.",19248.0,Walnut,622.jpg,image/jpeg,127484.0,2012-04-20 09:44:28 UTC,650.0,Nuts,Nuts,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:52 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:33 UTC,,,False,specific,16718.0,True,,,,,,100.0,,,,22200.0,,,,,52900.0,10400.0,,0.0,400.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,2782.5,0.0,1400.0,4466.666666666667,91075.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,41049.95,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,1090.0,832.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,9361.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,7.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,11300.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0189,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,4.6,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,352.0,,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,543.0138,,381.78000000000003,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,3.3,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-6.7971506,-13.795003,16
529,623,"Cetacea (Dolphin, Porpoise, Whale)",Cetacea,"The order Cetacea includes the marine mammals commonly known as whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Cetus is Latin and is used in biological names to mean 'whale'. Its original meaning, 'large sea animal', was more general. It comes from Ancient Greek ????? (k?tos), meaning 'whale' or ""any huge fish or sea monster"". In Greek mythology, the monster Perseus defeated was called Ceto, which is depicted by the constellation of Cetus. Cetology is the branch of marine science associated with the study of cetaceans.Fossil evidence suggests that the cetaceans share a common ancestor with land-dwelling mammals that began living in marine environments around 50 million years ago. Today, they are the mammals best adapted to aquatic life. The body of a cetacean is fusiform (spindle-shaped). The forelimbs are modified into flippers. The tiny hindlimbs are vestigial; they do not attach to the backbone and are hidden within the body. The tail has horizontal flukes.

530,624,"Columbidae (Dove, Pigeon)",Columbidae,"Pigeons and doves constitute the bird clade Columbidae, that includes about 310 species. Pigeons are stout-bodied birds with short necks, and have short, slender bills with fleshy ceres. Doves feed on seeds, fruits, and plants. This family occurs worldwide, but the greatest variety is in the Indomalaya and Australasia ecozones.In general, the terms ""dove"" and ""pigeon"" are used somewhat interchangeably. Pigeon derives from the Latin pipio, for a ""peeping"" chick, while dove is a Germanic word that refers to the bird's diving flight. In ornithological practice, ""dove"" tends to be used for smaller species and ""pigeon"" for larger ones, but this is in no way consistently applied, and historically, the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation between the terms. The species most commonly referred to as ""pigeon"" is the feral rock pigeon, common in many cities.Doves and pigeons build relatively flimsy nests ? often using sticks and other debris ? which may be placed in trees, ledges, or, on the ground, depending on species. They lay one or two eggs, and both parents care for the young, which leave the nest after seven to 28 days. Unlike most birds, both sexes of doves and pigeons produce ""crop milk"" to feed to their young, secreted by a sloughing of fluid-filled cells from the lining of the crop. Young doves and pigeons are called ""squabs"".",177061.0,Columbidae,624.jpg,image/jpeg,77036.0,2012-04-20 09:43:13 UTC,652.0,Animal foods,Poultry,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:52 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:33 UTC,,,False,specific,8930.0,True,,,,,,677.0,,,,4632.0,,,,,2324.0,96.0,,0.0,100.0,,,,,113.0,,,,,0.0,,44.0,,,,551.5,23900.0,0.0,0.0,13000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1605.0,,,,850.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,1334.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,82639.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,803.0,,,1457.0,,,,,,,,,,,2181.0,,0.0104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,-3.865675,12.044585,0

543,643,Honey,,"Honey is a sweet food made by bees using nectar from flowers. The variety produced by honey bees is the one most commonly referred to, as it is the type of honey collected by beekeepers and consumed by humans. Honey produced by other bees and insects has distinctly different properties. Honey bees transform nectar into honey by a process of regurgitation and evaporation. They store it as a primary food source in wax honeycombs inside the beehive. Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides, fructose, and glucose, and has approximately the same relative sweetness as that of granulated sugar. It has attractive chemical properties for baking, and a distinctive flavor that leads some people to prefer it over sugar and other sweeteners. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey because of its low water activity of 0.6. However, honey sometimes contains dormant endospores of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which can be dangerous to infants, as the endospores can transform into toxin-producing bacteria in the infant's immature intestinal tract, leading to illness and even death. Honey has a long history of human consumption, and is used in various foods and beverages as a sweetener and flavoring. It also has a role in religion and symbolism. Flavors of honey vary based on the nectar source, and various types and grades of honey are available. It is also used in various medicinal traditions to treat ailments. The study of pollens and spores in raw honey can determine floral sources of honey. Bees carry an electrostatic charge whereby they attract other particles in addition to pollen, which become incorporated into their honey; the honey can be analysed by the techniques of melissopalynology in area environmental studies of radioactive particles, dust and particulate pollution.",,Honey,643.jpg,image/jpeg,71095.0,2012-04-20 09:43:55 UTC,,Confectioneries,Other confectioneries,Type 2,2011-12-02 22:06:27 UTC,2015-10-02 21:24:47 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,,True,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,959.0,195.0,100.0,82806.66666666667,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.176,,,,1466.872,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.001,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3713.007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,319.0173,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,517.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,118.312,,,48.856,,,,,,,,,,,23.007,,257.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,-19.346493,-27.58354,8

Commercial vinegar is produced either by fast or slow fermentation processes. In general, slow methods are used with traditional vinegars, and fermentation proceeds slowly over the course of weeks or months. The longer fermentation period allows for the accumulation of a nontoxic slime composed of acetic acid bacteria. Fast methods add mother of vinegar to the source liquid before adding air using a venturi pump system or a turbine to promote oxygenation to obtain the fastest fermentation.

In addition to being consumed as an aperitif or cocktail ingredient, vermouth is sometimes used as a substitute for white wine in cooking. Historically, there have been two main types of vermouth, sweet and dry. Recently, however, vermouth manufacturers have begun experimenting and have created various styles, including white or bianco, amber, and rose. Vermouth is produced by starting with a base of a neutral grape wine. Each manufacturer adds additional alcohol and a proprietary mixture of dry ingredients, consisting of aromatic herbs, roots, and barks, to the base wine. After the wine is aromatized and fortified, the vermouth is sweetened with either cane sugar or caramel, depending on the style.

552,653,Toffee,,"Toffee is a confection made by caramelizing sugar or molasses along with butter, and occasionally flour. The mixture is heated until its temperature reaches the hard crack stage of 300 to 310 ŒÁF (149 to 154 ŒÁC). While being prepared, toffee is sometimes mixed with nuts or raisins. The process of making toffee requires the boiling of ingredients until the mix is stiff enough to be pulled into a shape which holds and has a glossy surface. The resulting mixture will typically be poured into a shallow tray and allowed to cool to form a sheet. Different mixes, processes, and most importantly, temperatures, will result in different textures and hardnesses, from soft and often sticky to a hard, brittle material. A popular variant in the US is English toffee, which is a very buttery toffee often made with almonds. It is available in both chewy and hard versions. Heath bars are a type of candy made with an English toffee core. Although named English toffee it bears little resemblance to the wide range of confectionery known as toffee currently available in the UK. Another variant is honeycomb toffee, which is an aerated version with bubbles introduced by adding baking soda and vinegar while mixing. These react to form carbon dioxide, which is trapped in the highly viscous mixture. In the UK and Canada, the most well known honeycomb candy is the Crunchie bar. The Australian equivalent is the Violet Crumble bar. In New Zealand, this is called hokey pokey. A particular application of toffee is in toffee apples, which are apples on sticks which are coated with toffee. Toffee apples are similar to taffy apples and caramel apples, which are both names for apples covered in caramel. In the UK, toffee apples, sometimes called candy apples, are coated with brittle candy similar to boiled sweets. Toffee used in confectionery can be mixed with many different ingredients to produce a variety of flavors: rum & butter, chocolate covered, vanilla & chocolate, rum & raisin, raspberry, and honeycomb.",,Toffee,653.jpg,image/jpeg,132633.0,2012-04-20 09:43:50 UTC,,Confectioneries,Other confectioneries,Type 2,2011-12-02 22:50:59 UTC,2017-03-29 20:25:03 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1896.5,1175.0,500.0,75250.0,15750.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,55.0,,,,27.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,112.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,79.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28.0,,,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,39.0,,30.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15.0,,,,-18.345022,-27.031603,8
553,654,Cake,,"Cake is a form of bread or bread-like food. In its modern forms, it is typically a sweet baked dessert. In its oldest forms, cakes were normally fried breads or cheesecakes, and normally had a disk shape. Determining whether a given food should be classified as bread, cake, or pastry can be difficult. Modern cake, especially layer cakes, normally contain a combination of flour, sugar, eggs, and butter or oil, with some varieties also requiring liquid and leavening agents. Flavorful ingredients like fruit purí©es, nuts, dried or candied fruit, or extracts are often added, and numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients are possible. Cakes are often filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces, iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders or candied fruit. Cake is often the dessert of choice for meals at ceremonial occasions, particularly weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur cook may bake a cake.",,Cake,654.jpg,image/jpeg,2175071.0,2012-04-20 09:41:34 UTC,,Confectioneries,Desserts,Type 2,2011-12-02 22:54:06 UTC,2017-03-29 20:25:03 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,,False,0.0,17.0,1.25,54.666666666666664,4.333333333333333,61.98,7.25,5612.0,1368.3333333333333,5109.28,18.333333333333332,,179.33333333333334,,2286.58,179.3,,0.0,7.044444444444444,3.0,0.0,3.3333333333333335,2.5,10.377777777777778,,38.0,2.0,0.6666666666666666,0.28888888888888886,1.6666666666666667,0.10256410256410256,0.0,,,946.9326923076923,4849.615384615385,1488.888888888889,61213.846153846156,11874.807692307691,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,95997.1729,,,,737466.4776999999,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8395.8855,615.9156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,527954.9284000002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5560.24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7840.3971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,164771.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1298.0007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,199297.008,,,97504.0316,,,,,,,,,,,97643.43580000002,,612803.7968000001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1887.1522000000002,,,,,,,,,,,,,32.925316,22.440218,8

555,656,Ymer,,"Ymer is a Danish soured milk product which has been known since 1930. It is made by fermenting whole milk with the bacterial culture Lactococcus lactis. When producing fermented milk products such as yogurt, ymer, filmjí_lk, skyr, qvark and A-38, and also when producing cheese, one can add lactic acid bacteria which convert milk sugar in the milk into lactic acid and other substances. Acidity makes the milk thicker, gives it a tart flavor, and increases the shelf life by several days.Unlike other fermented milk products, ymer is drained of its whey. That means that ymer has a higher content of solids, including protein, while the fat content stays at 3.5% as in whole milk.Ymer is used in breakfasts, snacks, desserts, dressings and baking. The traditional breakfast topping is ymerdrys (""ymer sprinkle""), which is a mix of rugbríŸd breadcrumbs and brown sugar. 1 deciliter of ymer contains 146 kJ (35 kilocalories).",,Ymer_(dairy_product),656.jpg,image/jpeg,46256.0,2012-04-20 09:28:52 UTC,,Milk and milk products,Fermented milk products,Type 2,2011-12-02 23:00:55 UTC,2017-03-29 20:25:03 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,274.5,3600.0,0.0,4200.0,2650.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,-21.770937,-5.5675983,15

Beverages, such as coffee, are not generally considered snacks though they may be consumed along with snack foods. A beverage may be considered a snack if it possesses a substantive food item (e.g., strawberries, bananas, kiwis) that has been blended to create a smoothie.Plain snacks like plain cereals, pasta, and vegetables are also mildly popular, and the word snack has often been used to refer to a larger meal involving cooked or leftover items.

558,660,Pastry,,"Pastry is the name given to various kinds of baked products made from ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder, and eggs. Small tarts and other sweet baked products are called ""pastries.""Pastry may also refer to the dough from which such baked products are made. Pastry dough is rolled out thin and used as a base for baked products. Common pastry dishes include pies, tarts, quiches and pasties.Pastry is differentiated from bread by having a higher fat content, which contributes to a flaky or crumbly texture. A good pastry is light and airy and fatty, but firm enough to support the weight of the filling. When making a shortcrust pastry, care must be taken to blend the fat and flour thoroughly before adding any liquid. This ensures that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and less likely to develop gluten. On the other hand, overmixing results in long gluten strands that toughen the pastry. In other types of pastry such as Danish pastry and croissants, the characteristic flaky texture is achieved by repeatedly rolling out a dough similar to that for yeast bread, spreading it with butter, and folding it to produce many thin layers.",,Pastry,660.jpg,image/jpeg,178225.0,2012-04-20 09:42:47 UTC,,Confectioneries,Desserts,Type 2,2011-12-02 23:16:48 UTC,2017-03-29 20:25:03 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,,False,0.0,7.619047619047619,0.0,53.0,4.0,53.56410256410256,6.842105263157895,4248.363636363636,1565.0,5935.430379746836,21.0,,498.0,701.3333333333334,2634.1139240506327,235.75,,0.4074074074074074,9.23943661971831,0.35294117647058826,0.0,0.0,0.4444444444444444,9.925373134328359,,28.0,0.0,0.0,1.3442622950819672,2.5,0.018867924528301886,0.0,153.33333333333334,0.0,996.1652542372881,6091.308411214954,2254.120879120879,50447.98923817615,18159.83432455395,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,117375.63050000001,,,,1197774.56054,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,101521.57000000002,9989.489699999998,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1185248.6719000002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,141890.1201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,210215.5205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,84043.066,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,201379.8863,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,146419.94999999998,,,186112.72809999998,,,,,,,,,,,233911.34300000002,,464211.87509000005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,79214.50129999996,,,,,,,,,16398.0,,,,33.91988,29.204983,8

562,664,Salad dressing,,"Sauces for salads are often called ""dressings"". The concept of salad dressing varies across cultures.In Western culture, there are three basic types of salad dressing:Vinaigrette;Creamy dressings, usually based on mayonnaise or fermented milk products, such as yogurt, sour cream (críÂme fraí¬che, smetana), buttermilk;Cooked dressings, which resemble creamy dressings, but are usually thickened by adding egg yolks and gently heating.Vinaigrette /v?n???r?t/ is a mixture (emulsion) of salad oil and vinegar, often flavored with herbs, spices, salt, pepper, sugar, and other ingredients. It is also used as a sauce or marinade.In North America, mayonnaise-based Ranch dressing is most popular, with vinaigrettes and Caesar-style dressing following close behind. Traditional dressings in France are vinaigrettes, typically mustard-based, while sour cream (smetana) and mayonnaise are predominant in eastern European countries and Russia. In Denmark, dressings are often based on críÂme fraí¬che. In southern Europe, salad is generally dressed by the diner with oil and vinegar.In Asia, it is common to add sesame oil, fish sauce, citrus juice, or soy sauce to salad dressings.",,Salad#Dressings,664.jpg,image/jpeg,42317.0,2012-04-20 09:41:37 UTC,,Baking goods,Dressings,Type 2,2011-12-05 16:42:26 UTC,2017-03-29 20:25:03 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,,False,0.5,2.5238095238095237,0.0,48.57142857142857,0.0,35.18032786885246,5.285714285714286,8588.42857142857,8.285714285714286,6692.868852459016,82.5,148.16666666666666,102.0,,12061.344262295082,1533.032786885246,,0.08333333333333333,57.01639344262295,3.6,0.0,20.0,4.333333333333333,2.0166666666666666,0.0,80.75,34.0,0.0,14.25,0.0,0.0,3.5,137.85714285714286,0.0,814.1776315789474,1119.142857142857,296.1904761904762,11525.63492063492,31062.214285714286,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,117169.2303,,,,504364.63881700014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,84038.356126,167537.428217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3270.0,,,,1542378.9962980004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,117121.74040000001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,61997.405790000004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,53112.74744,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,68704.75539,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,115256.1732,,,64534.40435000001,,,,,,,,,,,392912.8782799999,,262775.72564,,,,,,,,,,,,,14707.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,224932.24432999996,,,,,,,,,2070.0,,,,30.486744,30.379349,3

Sauces are not normally consumed by themselves; they add flavor, moisture, and visual appeal to another dish. Sauce is a French word taken from the Latin salsa, meaning salted. Possibly the oldest sauce recorded is garum, the fish sauce used by the Ancient Romans. Sauces need a liquid component, but some sauces may contain more solid elements than liquid. Sauces are an essential element in cuisines all over the world. Sauces may be used for savory dishes or for desserts. They can be prepared and served cold, like mayonnaise, prepared cold but served lukewarm like pesto, or can be cooked like bechamel and served warm or again cooked and served cold like apple sauce. Some sauces are industrial inventions like Worcestershire sauce, HP sauce, or nowadays mostly bought ready-made like soy sauce or ketchup, others still are freshly prepared by the cook. Sauces for salads are called salad dressing. Sauces made by deglazing a pan are called pan sauces.

564,666,Salt,,"Salt, also known as table salt or rock salt, is a crystalline mineral that is composed primarily of sodium chloride, a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of ionic salts. It is absolutely essential for animal life, but can be harmful to animals and plants in excess. Salt is one of the oldest, most ubiquitous food seasonings and salting is an important method of food preservation. The taste of salt (saltiness) is one of the basic human tastes. Salt for human consumption is produced in different forms: unrefined salt, refined salt (table salt), and iodized salt. It is a crystalline solid, white, pale pink or light gray in color, normally obtained from sea water or rock deposits. Edible rock salts may be slightly grayish in color because of mineral content. Because of its importance to survival, salt has often been considered a valuable commodity during human history. However, as salt consumption has increased during modern times, scientists have become aware of the health risks associated with high salt intake, including high blood pressure in sensitive individuals. Therefore, some health authorities have recommended limitations of dietary sodium, although others state the risk is minimal for typical western diets.",,Salt,666.jpg,image/jpeg,51925.0,2012-04-20 09:37:48 UTC,,Baking goods,Seasonings,Type 2,2011-12-05 16:53:52 UTC,2015-10-02 21:24:47 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,,True,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,284.0,,,,6209.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,615.0,282.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8093.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,115.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,955.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,243.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1201.0,,,1057.0,,,,,,,,,,,3253.0,,1962.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,311.0,,,,,,,,,10.0,,,,-18.390434,-2.0908482,3

568,670,Sugar,,"Sugar is the generalised name for a class of chemically-related sweet-flavored substances, most of which are used as food. They are carbohydrates, composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide (in the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose). Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar described as artificial sweeteners. Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants but are only present in sufficient concentrations for efficient extraction in sugarcane and sugar beet. Sugarcane is a giant grass and has been cultivated in tropical climates in the Far East since ancient times. A great expansion in its production took place in the 18th century with the setting up of sugar plantations in the West Indies and Americas. This was the first time that sugar became available to the common people who had previously had to rely on honey to sweeten foods. Sugar beet is a root crop and is cultivated in cooler climates and became a major source of sugar in the 19th century when methods for extracting the sugar became available. Sugar production and trade has changed the course of human history in many ways. It influenced the formation of colonies, the perpetuation of slavery, the transition to indentured labour, the migration of peoples, wars between sugar trade-controlling nations in the 19th century, and the ethnic composition and political structure of the new world. The world produced about 168 million tonnes of sugar in 2011. The average person consumes about 24 kilograms of sugar each year (33.1Œækg in industrialised countries), equivalent to over 260 food calories per person, per day. Sugar provides energy but no nutrientsäóîempty calories. Since the latter part of the twentieth century, it has been questioned whether a diet high in sugars, especially refined sugars, is bad for health. Sugar has been linked to obesity and suspected of being implicated in diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, macular degeneration and tooth decay. Numerous studies have been undertaken to try to clarify the position but the results remain largely unclear, mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations for use as controls that do not consume sugars.",,Sugar,670.jpg,image/jpeg,106764.0,2012-04-20 09:42:30 UTC,,Baking goods,Sugars,Type 2,2011-12-05 17:07:39 UTC,2015-10-02 21:24:47 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,,True,,,,,,0.0,,,,16.0,,,,,25.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1186.5,44.0,0.0,98319.33333333333,20.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1226.2060000000001,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,887.0,46.903,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41890.50600000001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,38541.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,96085.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6100.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,271.141,,,0.438,,,,,,,,,,,1971.991,,10918.294399999997,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30.0,,,,,,,,,2.0,,,,-12.074551,-23.863297,3

These are compounds with many times the sweetness of sucrose, common table sugar. As a result, much less sweetener is required and energy contribution is often negligible.

582,685,Water,,"Water is a chemical compound with the chemical formula H2O. A water molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms connected by covalent bonds. Water is a liquid at standard ambient temperature and pressure, but it often co-exists on Earth with its solid state, ice, and gaseous state. Water also exists in a liquid crystal state near hydrophilic surfaces. Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface, and is vital for all known forms of life. On Earth, 96.5% of the planet's water is found in oceans, 1.7% in groundwater, 1.7% in glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland, a small fraction in other large water bodies, and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds (formed of solid and liquid water particles suspended in air), and precipitation. Only 2.5% of the Earth's water is freshwater, and 98.8% of that water is in ice and groundwater. Less than 0.3% of all freshwater is in rivers, lakes, and the atmosphere, and an even smaller amount of the Earth's freshwater (0.003%) is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products. Water on Earth moves continually through the hydrological cycle of evaporation and transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea. Evaporation and transpiration contribute to the precipitation over land. Safe drinking water is essential to humans and other lifeforms even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world, but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate sanitation. There is a clear correlation between access to safe water and GDP per capita. However, some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the world population will be facing water-based vulnerability. A recent report (November 2009) suggests that by 2030, in some developing regions of the world, water demand will exceed supply by 50%. Water plays an important role in the world economy, as it functions as a solvent for a wide variety of chemical substances and facilitates industrial cooling and transportation.

591,695,Syrup,,"In cooking, a syrup or sirup is a thick, viscous liquid consisting primarily of a solution of sugar in water, containing a large amount of dissolved sugars but showing little tendency to deposit crystals.

Syrups can be made by dissolving sugar in water or by reducing naturally sweet juices such as cane juice, sorghum juice, or maple sap.

596,700,Curry powder,,"Curry powder is a spice mix of widely varying composition based on South Asian cuisine. Curry powder and the contemporary English use of the word curry are Western inventions and do not reflect any specific Indian food, though a similar mixture of spices used in north India is called garam masala. Curry powder is actually closer to the Tamil sambar powder, and the word curry is widely believed to be a corruption of the Tamil word kari, variously meaning something like sauce, cooked vegetables or meat. In the western world, curry powder mixtures tend to have a fairly standardized taste, though a great variety of spice mixtures are used in Indian cuisine. Curry powder was largely popularized during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries through the mass export of the condiment to the western table, throughout Europe and North and South America and through its use in British Army nations. Curry powder did not become standardized, as many of the original blends of curry powder were still available throughout the world. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw a growth of Indian-based food consumption in the west and internationally. This led to an increase of Indian restaurants throughout the world. The tradition of keeping special blends of curry powder simply became uneconomical, and curry powder became increasingly standardized outside India. Indian cooks often have readier access to a variety of fresh spices than their foreign counterparts. Some curry cooks will have their own specific mixtures for different recipes. These are often passed down from parent to child.",,Curry powder,700.jpg,image/jpeg,51762.0,2012-04-20 09:33:58 UTC,,Herbs and Spices,Herb and spice mixtures,Type 2,2011-12-07 00:17:26 UTC,2017-03-29 20:25:04 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,,False,,,,,,54.0,,,,4791.0,,,,,2120.0,429.0,,0.0,164.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,517.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1035.0,12660.0,33200.0,47250.0,13805.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33.0,,,,121.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,49.0,138.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3298.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,981.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,131.0,,,,,,,,,115.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,54.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,138.0,,,29.0,,,,,,,,,,,466.0,,191.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18.0,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,-17.52601,-29.366776,14
597,701,Other candy,,"Candy, also called sweets or lollies, is a confection that features sugar as a principal ingredient. The category, called sugar confectionery, encompasses any sweet confection, including chocolate, chewing gum, and sugar candy. Vegetables, fruit, or nuts which have been glazed and coated with sugar are said to be candied.Physically, candy is characterized by the use of a significant amount of sugar, or, in the case of sugar-free candies, by the presence of sugar substitutes. Unlike a cake or loaf of bread that would be shared among many people, candies are usually made in smaller pieces. However, the definition of candy also depends upon how people treat the food.

598,702,Meringue,,"Meringue, is a type of dessert, often associated with Swiss and French cuisine, made from whipped egg whites and sugar, and occasionally an acid such as cream of tartar or a small amount of vinegar. A binding agent such as cornstarch or gelatin may also be added. The addition of powdered sugar, which usually contains corn starch, to the uncooked meringue produces a pavlova, a national dish of Australia and New Zealand. The key to the formation of a good meringue is the formation of stiff peaks formed by denaturing the protein ovalbumin (a protein in the egg whites) via mechanical shear. Meringues are often flavoured with vanilla and a small amount of almond or coconut extract although if these extracts are based on an oil infusion then this, if used in excess, may inhibit the egg whites into forming a foam due to the fat from the oil. They are light, airy and sweet confections. Homemade meringues are often chewy and soft with a crisp exterior, although a uniform crisp texture may be achieved at home, whilst commercial meringues are crisp throughout.",,Meringue,702.jpg,image/jpeg,63916.0,2012-04-20 09:38:34 UTC,,Confectioneries,Other confectioneries,Type 2,2011-12-07 00:22:41 UTC,2017-03-29 20:25:04 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1791.0,2550.0,500.0,65050.0,16500.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,265.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,-17.808043,-26.208382,8

608,714,Buttermilk,,"Buttermilk refers to a number of dairy drinks. Originally, buttermilk was the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cream. This type of buttermilk is known as traditional buttermilk. The term buttermilk also refers to a range of fermented milk drinks, common in warm climates (e.g. , the Middle East, Pakistan, India, and the Southern United States) where unrefrigerated fresh milk sours quickly, as well as in colder climates, such as Germany, Poland, Scandinavia and the Netherlands. This fermented dairy product known as cultured buttermilk is produced from cow's milk and has a characteristically sour taste caused by lactic acid bacteria. This variant is made using one of two species of bacteriaäóîeither Streptococcus lactis or Lactobacillus bulgaricus, which creates more tartness. The tartness of buttermilk is due to acid in the milk. The increased acidity is primarily due to lactic acid produced by lactic acid bacteria while fermenting lactose, the primary sugar in milk. As the bacteria produce lactic acid, the pH of the milk decreases and casein, the primary milk protein, precipitates, causing the curdling or clabbering of milk. This process makes buttermilk thicker than plain milk. While both traditional and cultured buttermilk contain lactic acid, traditional buttermilk tends to be less viscous, whereas cultured buttermilk is more viscous. Buttermilk can be drunk straight, and it can also be used in cooking. Soda bread is a bread in which buttermilk reacts with the rising agent, sodium bicarbonate, to produce carbon dioxide.",,Buttermilk,714.jpg,image/jpeg,86704.0,2012-04-20 09:36:29 UTC,,Milk and milk products,Fermented milks,Type 2,2011-12-12 23:35:29 UTC,2015-10-02 21:24:48 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,,True,0.0,0.0,,,,47.25,,,,751.75,,,,,78.25,50.75,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,319.6,11230.0,0.0,9630.833333333334,1746.25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7284.0,,,,115399.25000000001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13734.0,1034.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,212710.78099999996,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40929.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3246.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27270.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2214.11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9715.0,,,1491.0,,,,,,,,,,,18521.0026,,9093.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1442.0,,,,,,,,,977.0,,,,12.508736,16.10564,15

618,726,Green turtle,Chelonia mydas,"The green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), also known as the green turtle, black (sea) turtle, or Pacific green turtle, is a large sea turtle of the family Cheloniidae. It is the only species in the genus Chelonia. Its range extends throughout tropical and subtropical seas around the world, with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The common name comes from the usually green fat found beneath its carapace. This sea turtle's dorsoventrally flattened body is covered by a large, teardrop-shaped carapace; it has a pair of large, paddle-like flippers. It is usually lightly colored, although in the eastern Pacific populations parts of the carapace can be almost black. Unlike other members of its family, such as the hawksbill sea turtle, C. mydas is mostly a herbivorous. The adults usually inhabit shallow lagoons, feeding mostly on various species of seagrasses. Like other sea turtles, green sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding grounds and hatching beaches. Many islands worldwide are known as Turtle Island due to green sea turtles nesting on their beaches. Females crawl out on beaches, dig nests and lay eggs during the night. Later, hatchlings emerge and scramble into the water. Those that reach maturity may live to eighty years in the wild. C. mydas is listed as endangered by the IUCN and CITES and is protected from exploitation in most countries. It is illegal to collect, harm or kill them. In addition, many countries have laws and ordinances to protect nesting areas. However, turtles are still in danger because of several human practices. In some countries, turtles and their eggs are hunted for food. Pollution indirectly harms turtles at both population and individual scales. Many turtles die caught in fishing nets. Also, real estate development often causes habitat loss by eliminating nesting beaches.",173833.0,Green sea turtle,726.jpg,image/jpeg,71044.0,2012-04-20 09:39:47 UTC,,Aquatic foods,Other aquatic foods,Type 1,2011-12-14 16:47:40 UTC,2017-06-08 01:36:16 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,8469.0,False,,,,,,15.0,,,,73.0,,,,,33.0,17.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,52.0,,,,,0.0,,12.0,,,,230.5,19800.0,0.0,0.0,500.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,433.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3139.0,522.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3264.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.549,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,760.0,,,342.0,,,,,,,,,,,712.00011,,5.429,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.098,,,,,,,,,,,,,-28.756151,-1.5227513,1

The strictest forms of vegetarianism are veganism and fruitarianism, which exclude all animal products, including dairy products as well as honey, and even some refined sugars if filtered and whitened with bone char. Vegetarian foods can be classified into several different types: Traditional foods that have always been vegetarian Soy products including tofu and tempeh which are common protein sources Textured vegetable protein (TVP), made from defatted soy flour, often included in chili and burger recipes in place of ground meat Meat analogues, which mimic the taste, texture, and appearance of meat and are often used in recipes that traditionally contained meat. Vegans may also use analogues for eggs and dairy products",,Vegetarian cuisine,793.jpg,image/jpeg,95771.0,2012-04-20 09:36:47 UTC,,Dishes,Other dishes,Type 2,2011-12-16 23:19:19 UTC,2017-03-29 20:25:05 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,,False,,5.0,0.0,,,103.28571428571429,2.0,,,2968.266666666667,,,,,5335.933333333333,653.1333333333333,,0.0,3.1538461538461537,0.0,,,1.0,0.23076923076923078,,8.0,,,0.7692307692307693,,0.0,,,,473.0858585858586,15855.858585858587,3973.469387755102,12649.89898989899,8230.20202020202,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21285.519560000004,,,,66540.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,449949.934,6026.024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,210407.65577999994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4800.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2202.005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,52.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10044.668,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20829.10304,,,43708.83469999999,,,,,,,,,,,85020.70126,,170630.60161000007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,63482.051,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.590855,24.840273,9

702,813,Nance,Byrsonima crassifolia,"Nance (also called craboo, kraabu, Savanna Serrette and Golden Spoon) is a species native to tropical America. It is valued for its small, sweet, yellow fruit, which are strongly scented. The fruits are eaten raw or cooked as dessert. In rural Panama, the dessert prepared with the addition of sugar and flour, known as pesada de nance, is quite popular. The fruits are also made into dulce de nance, a candy prepared with the fruit cooked in sugar and water. In Nicaragua (where the fruit is called nancite), it is a popular ingredient for several desserts, including raspados (mixed with ice).

715,829,Pita bread,,"Pita or pitta is a round pocket bread widely consumed in many Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, and Balkan cuisines. It is prevalent in Greece, the Balkans the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula and Turkey. The ""pocket"" in pita bread is created by steam, which puffs up the dough. As the bread cools and flattens, a pocket is left in the middle. Pita is used to scoop sauces or dips such as hummus and to wrap kebabs, gyros or falafel in the manner of sandwiches. Much of pita's popularity in the Western world since the 1970s is due to expanded use of the pocket for a type of sandwich. Instead of using pita to scoop foods, people fill the pocket with various ingredients to form a sandwich.

Ascidians are characterized by a tough outer ""tunic"" made of the polysaccharide tunicin, as compared to other tunicates which are less rigid.Ascidians are found all over the world, usually in shallow water with salinities over 2.5%. While members of the Thaliacea and Larvacea swim freely like plankton, sea squirts are sessile animals: they remain firmly attached to substratum, such as rocks and shells.There are 2,300 species of ascidians and three main types: solitary ascidians, social ascidians that form clumped communities by attaching at their bases, and compound ascidians that consist of many small individuals (each individual is called a zooid) forming colonies up to several meters in diameter.Sea squirts feed by taking in water through the oral siphon. The water enters the mouth and pharynx, flows through mucus-covered gill slits (also called pharyngeal stigmata) into a water chamber called the atrium, then exits through the atrial siphon.",158854.0,Ascidiacea,861.jpg,image/jpeg,210689.0,2012-04-20 09:32:18 UTC,,Aquatic foods,Other aquatic foods,Type 2,2011-12-21 01:50:02 UTC,2017-06-08 01:36:16 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,7713.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,51.0,3800.0,,0.0,500.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,230.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,833.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,811.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-22.496685,-4.1727014,1

This overlaps with but is distinct from the group of milk-like liquids called ""milks"" because of their similarity to the liquid produced by mammary glands.Lactose intolerance or a milk allergy can prompt the use of milk substitutes; they are also commonly consumed by vegans. Some milk substitutes are marketed to consumers as being more healthy than cow's milk, by being lower in saturated fat and for not containing cholesterol. When milk substitutes are lacking in vitamins or dietary minerals present in milk (such as vitamin B12 or calcium), they are sometimes fortified.The two most common categories of milk substitutes are grain milk and plant milk. The most common grain milk is rice milk, while the most common plant milk is soy milk. Other examples include hemp milk, coconut milk, almond milk, and peanut milk.

762,881,Cabbage,Brassica oleracea var. capitata,"Cabbage (Brassica oleracea or variants) is a leafy green biennial, grown as an annual vegetable for its dense-leaved heads. Closely related to other cole crops, such as broccoli, cauliflower and brussels sprouts, it descends from B. Œæoleracea var. oleracea, a wild field cabbage. Cabbage heads generally range from 1 to 8 pounds (to kg), and can be green, purple and white. Smooth-leafed firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed red and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colors seen more rarely. It is difficult to trace the exact history of cabbage, but it was most likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC. By the Middle Ages it was a prominent part of European cuisine, although savoys were not developed until the 16th century. Cabbage heads are generally picked during the first year of the plants' life cycles, but those intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year, and must be kept separated from other cole crops to prevent cross pollination. Cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as multiple pests, bacteria and fungal diseases. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reports that world production of cabbage and other brassicas (these plants are combined by the FAO for reporting purposes) for calendar year 2010 was almost 58,000,000 metric tons . Almost half were grown in China. Cabbages are prepared in many different ways for eating, although pickling, in dishes such as sauerkraut, is the most popular. Cabbage is a good source of beta-carotene, vitamin C and fiber. Cabbage when contaminated is sometimes a source of food-borne illness in humans.",,Cabbage,,,,,,Vegetables,Cabbages,Type 1,2012-09-05 15:25:14 UTC,2017-03-20 21:26:33 UTC,2.0,2.0,False,specific,3716.0,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9510.25,,38583.45,1732.45,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.9211,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2048.9251,,0.0,0.0,328.0,,,,3089.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,800.39,2.42,0.0,,,,1.11,0.0,,,21.181,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,353.0,,0.0,,50.123,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.552,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,112.977,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,380.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,7.062,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,488.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.14,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.03,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,270.0,,0.0,8880.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,420.0,,0.0,,,,,716.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,767.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,389.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,-17.655405,-20.178436,22
